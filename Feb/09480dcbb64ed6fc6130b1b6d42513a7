The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) chairman, Mahmood Yakubu, has postponed elections in 141 polling units in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State. Yakubu, while briefing journalists at the collation centre in Abuja, stated that the electoral process was disrupted in Wards 4, 6, 8, and 14, adding that “40 out of 141 polling units have materials intact.” He noted that the situation is now under control, and the commission decided to postpone the election after INEC ad hoc staff expressed apprehension about going back to conduct the election. INEC’s chairman added that the electoral body has decided that the election will be held tomorrow, on February 26. “We have a situation in Bayelsa state, particularly in the capital of Yenogoa where in four wards — wards 4,6,8,14 involving 141 polling units, the process was disrupted,” Yakubu said. “We remobilised security, and the situation is calm for us to continue the process. But the youth corps members expressed some apprehension about going back. “So we met with security agencies and we’ve decided that voting in these 141 polling units where the materials are actually intact, will take place tomorrow morning. Remember, we’re not only doing presidential election, but we are also doing sénatorial and federal constituencies. “So it’s good to recover and conduct the elections so that we can conclude the processes. The youth corps members who are serving as presiding officers and other commission staff, are agreeable that the elections should hold tomorrow morning.” He added that thugs attacked different polling units and that at least eight BVAS machines were stolen in different parts of the country. Yakubu, however, stated that backup BVAS machines were provided and noted that voting was delayed in a part of Niger State due to an attack by bandits in the area. He also acknowledged that there was a late arrival of electoral officials and materials in many polling units across Nigeria.
