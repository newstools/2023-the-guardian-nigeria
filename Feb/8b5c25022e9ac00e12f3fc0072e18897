A support group has distributed 21 campaign vehicles across the 20 local councils of Bauchi State to mobilise votes at the grassroots for the presidential candidate of All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu. The convener of ‘Lobito Group for Tinubu’, Mr. Idris Lanzai, said the vehicles were given to council coordinators, who would persuade rural dwellers to vote for the candidate during the February 25, 2023 election. Lanzai said: “They are to do door-to-door campaign, mobilise people and show them how to vote for APC.” Also, the party’s candidate for Bauchi Central Senatorial District and a former chairman of APC, Uba Nana, said Tinubu has the capacity to bring positive changes to the nation, noting that all electorate should support Tinubu’s vision for the country. Nana said opposition parties would not understand the situation of the country because they are not in government. Hence, they could easily blame the party. He was optimistic of victory for all the party’s candidates, adding that Bauchi State is largely an APC stronghold.
