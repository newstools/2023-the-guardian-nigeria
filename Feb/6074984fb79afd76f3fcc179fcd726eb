Anti-corruption and Civil Society Organisations (CSOs), yesterday, said Chairman of Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Abdulrasheed Bawa, is infiltrating to cover his alleged misdeeds. The claim comes amid joining of over 120 CSOs to demand his removal from office for “vilolation to court judgments and becoming embarrassment to the nation’s anti-corruption fight.” They alleged that Bawa was “hurriedly raising questionable groups to protest in his favour.” According to them, lavishing money on groups willing to be used against wellbeing of Nigerians and rule of law, “is the stock in trade of the EFCC boss and others like him in the current administration.” The CSOs, which had petitioned the National Assembly against “politicisation of the EFCC, disobedience of court orders, and infringement on human rights of Nigerians,” observed that prominent activists and pro-democracy campaigners with over 30-year experience are those seeking Bawa’s exit. Director, Activists for Good Governance, Declan Ihehaire, noted: “We are rugged, patriotic activists, who will not bow to any intimidation. Struggle is not new to us and we cannot be bought by anybody. When we believe in a cause, especially when it is in the interest of the majority of Nigerians and the fight against corruption, we will give it our all.” On his part, president of Coalition of Yoruba Youth Councils, Abe Emmanuel Kolawole, said he joined the struggle for better security. The protests, organised by CACOL Chairman, Debo Adeniran; Executive Director, Zero Graft Centre, Kolawole Sanchez-Jude; Chairman, Coalition Against Corruption and Bad Governance, Toyin Raheem; Executive Director, Centre for Public Accountability, Olufemi Lawson; spokesperson for Transparency and Accountability Group, Ayodeji Ologun; Director, Activists for Good Governance, Declan Ihehaire and Ahmed Balogun of Media Rights said the initiative was to ensure free, fair and credible elections nationwide.
