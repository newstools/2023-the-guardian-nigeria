Cordros capital said: “We believe investors will be focused on the outcome of the highly anticipated 2023 Presidential elections. Thus, we see more of a ‘choppy theme’ as cautious trading dominates the trading activities. “Overall, we advise investors to seek trading opportunities in only fundamentally sound stocks as the weak macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.” According analysts at Vetiva Dealings and Brokerage said: “Investors bought up stocks across board, as all sectors closed the day in the green. We anticipate a mixed session to start off the week while we expect the outcome of the election to determine market direction in the new week.” Afrinvest said: “Despite the upbeat investor sentiment, we anticipate cautious trading next week as post-election developments unravel.” Further breakdown of last week’s transactions showed that the financial services industry (measured by volume) led the activity chart with 480.1million shares valued at N6.1 billion traded in 6,319 deals; thus contributing 60.03 per cent to turnover volume.
