It was a memorable experience for Abiodun Sashoya, a director in Lagos State Ministry of Transportation as he narrated the experience of his first train ride, 
Sashoya was among participants in the first-test run of the blue light rail on Monday, which started from Marina train station, witnessed by students, University of Lagos lecturers, top government functionaries, journalists, and heads of government agencies. Reliving his experience to The Guardian, Sashoya said:  “This is the first time I will ever get on a train, I have never been on a train. So, for me, it’s an experience I cannot forget. I was actually looking forward to it. I told my children that daddy is going to get on the train for the first time. I am in my 50’s. This is my first time on a moving train, I have crossed Ebute-Meta and seen parked and moving trains but this my first experience.
 
“ I think it’s an experience, we are doing something for the first time. This is something that is an everyday experience for some other people. I feel a little bit embarrassed to tell anyone that it’s my first time on the train but it’s very exciting, it’s comfortable, the time frame is short.
 
“I hope Lagosians will make good use of this facility so they don’t turn it to another thing. I am sure government has expended huge capital in doing this. We should make good use of this.  I want to commend the government for their efforts. By the time all these are completed, Lagos will be a completely different state.”
  
For Peter Henderson, a 200-level Geography student of the University of Lagos, the trip from Marina to Mile 2 and back was his first. According to him, the trip was pretty safe and fast as it was done in less than 30 minutes.
  
Henderson, who said he was among students invited for the ride because they were studying a course on transport, said the time frame of the trip would have been longer, if they were using other means of transport.
