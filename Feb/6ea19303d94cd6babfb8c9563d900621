Southern Kaduna Peoples Union (SOKAPU) has faulted recent remarks by former Emir of Kano, Sanusi Lamido Sanusi, against Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom over helicopter shelling of those killed in Doma, Nasarawa State. In a statement by its spokesman, Luka Binniyat, the group noted: “Let it be put on record that SOKAPU condemns unreservedly the murder of innocent citizens or any human resident in Nigeria irrespective of race, tribe, religion or region. “Southern Kaduna has had more than it can handle from such cruelty, especially in the past eight years, so, we know what mass murder of harmless law-abiding citizens means.” “The January 24, 2023 bombing of Akwanaja village, Doma Council of Nasarawa State against targets, which Fulani leaders said were innocent herders, has been massively reported in the media,” pointing out that “the Air Force authorities have owned up to the bombings and defended its action.” He went on: “But, if indeed, those killed in the bombing are innocent herders, justice must take its course and full restitution paid (to) their families. “On January 30, 2023, former Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria wrote and signed a strong-worded letter laced with allegations and threats against Governor Ortom to President Muhammadu Buhari and the letter found its way into the press.” SOKAPU added: “If a state government enacts a law that every resident of the state is bound to abide by, no ethnic group has the exclusive right to disrespect such a law no matter how privileged and protected it may be. The most civilised thing to do is to follow the democratic process of reviewing the law or repealing it. “We, therefore, expect Sanusi and his tribal leaders to encourage his kinsmen to respect the laws of Benue State as long as they are on (our) soil, while seeking for legal ways to amend or repeal any law they find objectionable to the interest of their people.”
