Chieftains of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim, has said that politics driven by personal ambition and self-interest being played in the country is the bane of democratic growth. Speaking to reporters in Ilorin, Kwara State, yesterday, he said commitment to ideology-based politics and principles are urgently required to make the nation’s democracy flourish. Olawepo-Hashim said these ideals made the Second Republic the most flowery in the country’s democratic history, adding: “This has been the reason it seems like Nigeria’s past was more meaningful than the present. “If we want rapid development as we saw in the First Republic, when Nigeria was a leading light among Third World countries, our leadership recruitment must be based on the ideals that politicians stand for; their personal records, rather than their financial war chests.” The former presidential aspirant noted that meaningless talks, such as ‘it is my turn’, and religious bigotry will only continue to divide the country and plunge it into violence. The party system where principles and ideology reign, he submitted, must be revived and restored, while party supremacy returns.
