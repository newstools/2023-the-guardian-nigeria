A Federal High Court has dismissed the suit by Abdullahi Adamu Mohammed and two others against Independent National Electoral Commission, (INEC), All Progressives Congress (APC), and  Senator Uba Sani seeking to annul the Ward, Local Government, State, and National congresses. Recall that the suit sought the annulment of all the APC congresses, ultimately disqualifying all candidates of the ruling party in Kaduna State and setting aside the election of the EXCOS. The dismissal of the suit, according to counsel to the APC in Kaduna, who was also a former NBA Chairman in the State, Sule Shuaibu Esq, was following a judgment delivered by the Federal High Court, Kaduna Division on Monday afternoon. Sani supporters in the Kaduna State  APC were seen jubilating in the city’s various campaign offices shortly after the court verdict was given. The latest judgment is coming on the heels of another verdict earlier delivered by the Supreme Court of Nigeria  Wednesday 8th February 2023 in which two appeals were brought against the Independent National  Electoral Commission (INEC), the All Progressives Congress (APC), and its governorship candidate, Senator Uba Sani by Hon Sani Mahmoud Sha’aban were equally dismissed.
