Imo State government, yesterday, declared that the self-acclaimed spokesman of Conference of United Political Parties (CUPP), Ikenga Ugochinyere, has, once more, shot himself in the foot during a media briefing in Abuja, on Wednesday, by lying and confirming that he is unfit to occupy public office, particularly, representing Ideato Federal Constituency in the National Assembly. The state government said Ugochinyere was a persistent attention seeker, who is destroying himself politically by constantly and baselessly attacking the state governor, Hope Uzodimma, just to draw attention to himself in a desperate bid to help his political misadventure. It, therefore, urged Nigerians to ignore him. The state Commissioner for Information, Declan Emelumba, in a statement in Owerri, yesterday, said: “Ugochinyere failed, all through the over one hour of his rambling, to either acknowledge the brutal murder of his own council’s sole administrator or to commiserate with his family, or even include him among those he observed one minute silence for. “Ideato North, where the late sole administrator came from, is one of the two councils that Ugochinyere is seeking to represent in the House of Representatives. By this callous act of condoning the brutal murder of his own council chairman, while shouting at the rooftops about the murder of his uncle and associates, Ugochinyere has presented himself incapable of representing Ideato people without prejudice. He has presented himself as unfit for the political office he seeks.” The commissioner further recalled that Ugochinyere had earlier announced there were, at least, 14 All Progressives Congress (APC) states involved in his allegations of voter registration fraud. He added: “Now, he claims that it is those he exposed in that regard that were after his life. Assuming that is correct, without conceding, the question then is, why single out Uzodimma? This shows he is a liar, and irredeemably enmeshed in self-contradictions.”
