Director-General, Development Agenda for Western Nigeria (DAWN) Commission, Seye Oyeleye, has called on the South West electorate to focus on the region’s security and sustainability as they go to the poll on Saturday to elect a new president. Oyeleye stated, yesterday: “As Nigerians go to the polls on Saturday, DAWN Commission calls on the Western Nigeria public to focus on the region’s security and sustainability as a composite unit and reinforce its uniqueness as a welcoming, tolerant and law-abiding space, where the peaceful coexistence and welfare of all residents, irrespective of their ethnic origin and tongue, is paramount.” According to him, the commission aligns with the Southern governors and 11 governors from the North for a southern successor to President Muhammadu Buhari. “Since making their declarations, the stance has gained majority backing and consensual popularity. The commission, as a development-focused agency, readily supports initiatives that promote the development of our space. Therefore, it supports these governors’ stance for power to shift to the South, as a necessity to strengthen Nigeria’s democracy and engender political stability, without which there can be no development.” DAWN commission also reminded voters, particularly those from the South West, to vote in a manner that guarantees stability and tranquility, to ensure the continuity of various strategic ongoing economic development projects in the region.
