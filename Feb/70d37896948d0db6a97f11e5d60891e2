Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Akwa Ibom State has said the Commission has not recruited any ad hoc staff ahead of the forthcoming election. State Resident Electoral Commissioner, Dr. Cyril Omorogbe, made the denial in chat with The Guardian. Omorogbe spoke while refuting allegation by Young Progressives Party (YPP) that INEC in the state received a list from Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) containing names of beneficiaries of Governor Udom Emmanuel’s Entrepreneurship Ibom 3,000 Project for employment as ad hoc staff. The REC wondered why desperation would make politicians to speculate and jump  to conclusions on issues they don’t know anything about. Omorogbe also denied that the head of ICT in INEC in the state is colluding with the state government.  He stressed that the Commission  is open to any political parties that has questions,  especially  on the workings  of BVAS. He stressed that INEC  would follow religiously the  rules of free, fair and credible elections that would be universally acclaimed. “As the REC, I will not take side and my door is open to any political stakeholder with questions or needs clarification. YPP don’t know what they are saying because INEC in Akwa Ibom  does not have a portal,” he said. He revealed that INEC had performed mock accreditation of voters  in six councils  across  the three senatorial  districts in the state to ascertain the efficiency of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS). The mock exercise, according to him, took place in Uyo, Ibesikpo, Essien Udim, Ikot Ekpene, Eket and Onna councils.
