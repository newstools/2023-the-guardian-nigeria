Edo State has recorded four new deaths from Lassa fever, raising the total number of fatalities from the disease in the state to 20. Edo State Commissioner, Prof. Akoria Obehi, who disclosed this while briefing journalists in Benin City, said the new deaths were recorded in three councils in the state, namely: Etsako West, Etsako Central and Owan East. He said most of the deaths recorded involved persons, who were unwell and failed to report to a proper hospital for care until they developed complications.   He ugred residents to “take responsibility to work with the Ministry of Health, observe preventive measures and report early symptoms suspected to be malaria or any other sickness that present like malaria so as to receive early and proper care.” Noting that the state’s fatality rate has increased to 13 per cent, Akoria said the state has now recorded a total of 155 confirmed cases from 11 councils of the state. She said: “While the government is stepping up efforts to curb the spread of Lassa fever across all Edo communities, including improving sensitisation campaigns and surveillance and response activities, we urge everyone to be aware and take responsibility to work with the ministry of health and other partners, observe preventive measures against the spread of the disease and report early symptoms suspected to be malaria or any other illnesses that present like malaria.”
