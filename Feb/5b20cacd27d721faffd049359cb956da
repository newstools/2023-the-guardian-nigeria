The youth wing of the apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council, yesterday, waded into the issue of the 2023 governorship election in Enugu State, telling politicians to stop malicious campaigns and face real issues. The group noted that the governorship candidate of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Peter Mbah, has been in the centre of the storm, facing allegations of certificate forgery and syphoning Enugu funds. A statement by the National President of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council, Okwu Nnabuike, urged politicians to desist from playing bitter politics. Recall that a former governor of old Anambra State, Jim Nwobodo, had, last week, cautioned that Enugu politics is fast assuming a dangerous dimension. Okwu, who said the 2023 governorship elections in the state should not be “a do or die affair,” noted that only one person would win the election. He said: “The media briefing became necessary owing to latest developments in the politics of Enugu.
“For some weeks now, Enugu has been in the news from one allegation to another against Mbah. The latest is that Mbah did not participate in the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) scheme.
“We also have listened to Mbah’s explanations when he appeared on a Solid FM phone-in programme and are convinced that he, indeed, participated and completed the exercise.
“Now that this has been laid to rest, candidates and their supporters should embark on issue-based campaigns. They should tell Enugu people what they have in stock for them if elected governor. Name-calling, character assassination and bitter politics should stop. There is life after the 2023 elections.” He restated that youths are in support of Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi and his choice of Mbah as successor, stressing: “The PDP candidate has provided a clear roadmap and successor plan to take Enugu to the next level.”
