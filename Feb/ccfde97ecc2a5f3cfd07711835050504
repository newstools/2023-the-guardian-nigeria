The Rivers State Government has withdrawn its earlier approval of the Adokiye Amiesimaka Stadium given to the  Peoples Democratic Party’s Presidential Campaign for its mega rally in Port Harcourt scheduled for Saturday, February 11, 2023. A statement signed by The State Commissioner for Sports, Christopher Green, said the withdrawal followed credible intelligence to the government and recent developments indicating that the presidential campaign organisation was working in collaboration with a faction of All Progressives Congress (APC) led by Tonye Cole. The statement alleged that the plan of the PDP was to share and accommodate the APC faction in the approved facility. The statement further asserted that APC rallies were usually marred with violence due to internal crisis. It said the government would not risk damages to its valuable assets and hence, has decided to withdraw the earlier approved facility given to PDP presidential campaign for use. Meanwhile, the Spokesperson of the PDP Presidential Campaign Council in Rivers, Leloonu Nwibubase, who confirmed the development said they were not surprised by the governor’s action. He said they were aware that the approval earlier granted by the governor was a Greek gift insisting that they were not rattled by the development. When asked whether they were making an alternative arrangement to hold the rally, he said: “For us, I will say very clearly that the Presidential Campaign Council in Rivers State is not rattled at all. What has happened is not a surprise so we have our options on the table. “We will speak to the teeming PDP supporters and supporters of our presidential candidate in due course. We will continue with our campaign. We are very sure that the ultimate goal is for Rivers to vote for Atiku Abubakar as their Presidential Candidate and that we will succeed. We will unveil our options”.
