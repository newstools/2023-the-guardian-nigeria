  To ensure peaceful and violence-free elections as provided for in the Violence Against Persons Prohibition, (VAPP), Act 2015, the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons, (NAPTIP), has begun mobilization of its personnel to monitor and ensure peaceful polls. Director General, NAPTIP, professor Fatima Waziri-Azi, made this known while briefing the press on efforts of the agency towards ensuring peaceful polls by tackling electoral violence as stipulated in the VAPP act. She said pointed out that based on recent electoral violence across the country since the beginning of the present electioneering process especially attacks on the Independent National Electoral Commission, (INEC), facilities, it has become necessary for NAPTIP to deliberately work with sister law enforcement agencies to implement the Act. “The meaningful participation of all persons in political processes is key to achieving a more secure, prosperous and democratic society. “However, this can be obstructed by political violence which is why sections 23 and 24 of the VAPP Act prohibits all forms of political violence by individuals and state actors,” she explains. According to her, political violence is a crime perpetrated in the course of political activities like elections and this includes thuggery, mugging, use of force to disrupt meetings and the use of dangerous weapons that may cause bodily harm among others Waziri-Azi also tasked parents and guardians to caution their children to stay away from all acts of violence as the VAPP Act stipulates stiff penalties against offenders and all those held liable. She said “In collaboration with the Center for Democracy and Development, (CDD), the agency, (NAPTIP), has put in place a number of mechanisms targeted at sensitising the public against perpetrating acts of political violence. “The VAPP is very clear about what constitutes political violence and the different category and groups that will be held liable for committing, inciting, aiding and abetting political violence.” The DG also unveiled awareness creation materials including posters, red card handbills were written in Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba and other languages for use by NAPTIP officers to sensitize the public.
