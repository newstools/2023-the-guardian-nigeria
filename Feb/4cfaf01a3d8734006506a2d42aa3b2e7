Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State has upgraded Ogun State College of Health Technology, Ilese, Ijebu-Ode to Ogun State Polytechnic of Health and Allied Sciences. Abiodun stated this at an engagement with students of the institution, during a campaign tour of Ijebu Ode Council. He said the institution, with its new status will soon have a substantive rector, and assured that his administration will continue to support the development of education in the state. He said: “This institution will now begin to occupy its pride of place among the comity of polytechnics in the country, I want to congratulate you on this elevation, and I want to assure you that very soon, you will have a substantive rector.” Abiodun reassured that his government would continue to look out for the welfare of students, adding that his administration would look at the issue of bursary and ensure its immediate payment. While promising that work would begin on internal roads of the institution in the next one week, Abiodun said Ilese road, which was recently re-awarded by his administration, would soon be completed. Abiodun later commissioned the Atan- Erunwon Road in Ijebu North-East Council and Molipa expressway in Ijebu-Ode council. Earlier, president of the student union government, Rafiu Rilwan, while acknowledging the governor for his support towards the development of the school, asked for the renaming of the institution.
