Download logo The Black Sea Grain Initiative has facilitated the shipment of more than 18 million tonnes of grain and other food products from Ukraine between June 2022 and January 2023. Most of Ukrainian wheat (65%) and about half of its corn were taken to developing countries.  The grain shipments also enable WFP to deliver humanitarian assistance to countries worst affected by the food crisis. With Finland’s support, WFP is buying Ukrainian grain, which it grinds, clears through customs and delivers to the Horn of Africa, among other regions. “Through WFP, Finland is supporting both Ukraine and the countries affected by the food crisis. Ukraine will get income it needs and the countries suffering from grain shortage and high prices will get much-needed grain,” says Minister for Development Cooperation and Foreign Trade Ville Skinnari. Implementing the Black Sea Grain Initiative will also stabilise global food prices. Finland supported the implementation of the Black Sea Grain Initiative already last year by financing grain shipments from Ukraine to Somalia.
