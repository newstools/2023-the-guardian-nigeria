Renowned sports administrator, Abba Yola, has commended organisers of the yearly Sportsville Awards, even as Abuja-based women’s football promoter, Paul Edeh, has described the award to be bestowed on him as heartwarming. Yola said he is particularly happy with the award being bestowed on former Director General of the defunct National Sports Commission (NSC), Dr. Patrick Ekeji, adding that the ex NSC boss is one Nigerian that has done well when it comes to sports administration and deserves whatever honour that comes his way. “Ekeji is an excellent sports administrator. He was my boss at the National Sports Commission (NSC) and I can attest to his brilliance, thoroughness and ability. He took Nigerian sports to an enviable height during his regime. “He would be remembered for his pet Team Nigeria project that attracted the private sector to Nigerian sports. I am happy the organisers of the Sportsville Awards found him worthy to be honoured,” Yola added. Edeh, on his part, said he was pleasantly surprised by the award as he never saw it coming. “Yes, I have been contributing my little quota to the development of our sports, but I never knew some people somewhere would say… hey, you are doing well with an award. “I didn’t solicit it and to that extent, I consider it a very credible award and I will be in Lagos to receive it,” the Naija Ratel proprietor said The Sportsville award is billed for this Saturday at the Lagos Country Club, Ikeja, with Sports Minister, Sunday Dare, as chairman of the day, while Edo State Deputy Governor, Philip Shaibu, is the special guest of honour.
