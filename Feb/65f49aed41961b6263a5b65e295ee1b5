Presidential candidate of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and former Vice President of Nigeria, Atiku Abubakar, has congratulated the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) on the emergence of Comrade Joe Ajaero as its new national president. He also congratulated the 15 other members of the new executive committee of organised labour. The congratulatory message, which was contained in a statement signed by his Media Adviser, Paul Ibe, said the emergence of Ajaero indicates NLC is keeping faith with its mandate of protecting the interest of the masses. Atiku noted that the new NLC national president is a consummate unionist, and it is clear his tenure will engender good tidings for Nigerian workers. “Comrade Joe Ajaero has a career of unflinching commitment to unionism, and it is only deserving that he has emerged as the number one union leader in the country,” Atiku said. Similarly, All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, sent his goodwill and congratulatory message to Ajaero. He said: “I congratulate the new NLC President, Comrade Joe Ajaero, for his election, particularly for having the confidence of his colleagues who unanimously elected him unopposed. “Being elected by your colleagues is a measure of confidence and trust in your demonstrable ability to lead the NLC to new era of progress, cooperation and value creation for Nigerian workers and the entire people of our blessed country. “I charge the new labour leader to use his position to mobilise the entire workforce for better national productivity and increased economic output that will quicken our quest for shared prosperity while fighting for social and economic justice and upholding the rights of workers.”
