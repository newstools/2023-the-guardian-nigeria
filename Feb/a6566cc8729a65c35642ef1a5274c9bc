A cross-section of Abuja residents have expressed different views over
expiry date, date of manufacture and Best Before (BB) inscribed on packaged food products, drugs, cosmetics, among others.

While some say they check such information before they buy, some say they dont, as they just go ahead and buy what they want and move on. A check by a News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) correspondent in Abuja found that many people are not even aware
of such dates, some do not bother to check, while others do not even know how to check and do not know its significance.

Some others also blame food dealers for not duly passing useful information about their products. Expiration date or expiry date is a previously determined date after which something should no longer be used, either by operation of law or by exceeding the anticipated shelf life for perishable goods.
Expiration dates tell consumers the last day a product is safe to consume, while Best Before date tells if food is no longer in its perfect shape from that date as it may lose freshness, taste, aroma or nutrients.
Mr James Abah, a civil servant in Abuja, said he seldom check for information of a product, as most times,
he just buys and goes. He added that “if I buy things like butter, tea or beverage, I don’t check for expiry date because I can always return it to the shop, and if the product is not expensive, I just forgo. “There are instances where the seller will also not collect the item sold, and one just have to bear it.”
