The nonpayment of N4000 training allowance to independent electoral commission (INEC) adhoc staffers has slowed the commencement of the voting exercise in Dorayi Karamar ward in Gwale local council of Kano state. There are no fewer than 30 polling units in the densely populated ward in Kano. It was observed that hundreds of voters who left their homes to exercise their franchise were kept waiting till the issue is resolved by INEC officials. An agent of the opposition new Nigeria peoples party (NNPP), Malam Sani Madugu called on INEC to wade in immediately. Voting is yet to commence as at 9:am when the Guardian monitored the exercise in the ward.
