SGFC Athletics Sports Club suffered a slim 1-0 loss to the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) challengers, Kwara United, in a friendly duel played yesterday at the KFA pitch. A late deflected strike from Mohammed Bajibril in the 86th minutes was what Harmony Boys needed to edge the Eagles in what was a cagey affair between both sides. Kwara United also had the chance to go ahead when Paul Samson’s effort was headed out from the goal line by Henry Ndubisi to keep his team level after goalkeeper Godwin Friday was clearly beaten. Iman Abdulgafar also came close scoring from the free kick on the far right but his efforts was brilliantly chipped over the bar by the legendary Dele Ayienugba in goal for United. Head Coach of SGFC Athletics, Mashood Yakub, said he was satisfied with his team’s performance, adding that they gave everything, but were unlucky to concede at the manner at which they did. “The boys put in everything and we almost got a draw. It was a top performance from the team. I am satisfied with the tenacity in them, it shows we are working. It’s always a must win, that is the principle and the boys have to stick to that,” he added. SGFC Athletics will be in action again today, as they file out against Nationwide FC in the quarterfinal of the ongoing Wali of Ilorin Cup.
