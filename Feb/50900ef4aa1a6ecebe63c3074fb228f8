The Ichen community in Dong Council has kicked against moves by Governor Darius Ishaku to site headquarters of the newly created Buban District in Mararaba-Sabongida, as against Lagos-Buban, the ancestral headquarters of the Buban clan, warning that the decision could spark fresh crisis in Taraba State. Led by its chairman, Ali Janya Samuel, during a media briefing, yesterday, in Jalingo, the community said picking Mararaba-Sabongida, headquarters of Benye District, would be tantamount to a slip capable of causing disharmony among the people and compromising existing peace. To avert the looming crisis, Samuel called on security agencies to investigate the matter and make necessary recommendations. He warned that if the matter is treated with levity, it could affect conduct of the general elections, which begin this weekend. No fewer than 34 polling units in the state had been shut by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) due to insecurity. Briefing journalists in the state capital, the community chairman, while lauding the governor for creating the new district, alleged: “There are indications of attempt by haters of peace to mislead Ishaku on the siting of the Buban district headquarters.” He warned that “any act capable of threatening our peaceful coexistence is also capable of frustrating efforts of the government for peaceful elections and smooth transition.” Stating that they are not against creation of Buban District and subsequent coronation of the head, the community noted:  “This singular attempt of trying to mislead the governor to designate Mararaba-Sabongida, headquarters of Benye District, as the headquarters of another district is dangerous to our long peaceful coexistence.” The action, if allowed to succeed, Samuel added, “has the potential of plunging the entire Benye District and environs into chaos.”
