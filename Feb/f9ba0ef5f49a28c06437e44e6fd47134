Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola (SAN), has appealed to the governments of Kano, Katsina and Jigawa states to prevail on local dwellers in the axes to restore right of way on federal roads. Fashola made the appeal, yesterday, while flagging off the N115 billion Kano/Kongolam highway dualisation at Mararabar Gwiwa village in Kazaure Local Council of Jigawa State. He lamented the incessant conflict between contractors and locals over the right of way across the country, calling for urgent intervention even from traditional rulers. The minister explained that dualisation of the 132-kilometre stretch originated from Dawanau roundabout in Kano, spanning through Kazaure in Jigawa and Daura up to Kongolam in Katsina would aid economic growth. According to him, the project, being financed by the BUA Group under the Federal Government Roads Infrastructure Tax Credit Policy, is a statement of confidence in President Muhammad Buhari’s administration. The former Lagos State governor maintained that Buhari’s administration would remain on the positive side of history for deploying the billion of dollars, hitherto stolen public fund, in critical economic sector. Chairman BUA Group, Abdulsamad Rabiu, expressed the commitment of the group to take advantage of the tax credit policy to undertake the 132km road to be completed in three years. Represented by the Group Executive Managing Director, BUA Group, Kabiru Rabiu, the chairman said the group is dedicated to complementing Federal Government’s Executive Order 009, which is already impacting the economy.
