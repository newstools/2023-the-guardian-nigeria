Super Eagles Striker, Paul Onuachu, says he cannot wait to start his Southampton career. Onuachu joined Southampton on deadline day from Genk for a fee said to be a little over £18 million. The 28-year-old striker signed a three-and-a-half-year contract at St Mary’s to become Southampton’s fifth recruit of the January transfer window, following Ghanaian forward Kamaldeen Sulemana through the door at St Mary’s during the final hours of deadline day. His arrival from Belgian side Genk was announced at 12.30am yesterday morning after the deadline for the January window, with Saints having submitted a deal sheet to the Premier League to complete the transfer. Onuachu is expected to fly to Southampton today to start the next chapter of his career, which sees him leave Belgium after three and a half years with Genk that saw him score 85 goals in 134 games. The 6ft 7ins striker will now be tasked with helping Saints stay in the Premier League this season, with Nathan Jones’ side currently bottom of the table after 20 games. And Onuachu is already looking forward to getting that job underway, sending a video message to Saints fans yesterday afternoon after his transfer was confirmed. He said: “Hi Saints fans, it’s Paul Onuachu here. I’m very excited to join this amazing club and I can’t wait to meet you guys and get started. Let’s go!”
