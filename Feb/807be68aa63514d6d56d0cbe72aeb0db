Accessorising for men is usually clean and simple with a strong sense of masculinity. While some cultures are no strangers to men with heavy accessories and embellishments, accessories are taking a front seat in the 21st century male fashion. Gone with the wind are the days of men’s accessories being restricted to a watch and a pair of cufflinks. Sure, those are powerful accessories, but there’s so much more to men’s jewellery than just those two. With male fashion becoming more inclusive, versatile and intentional, let’s talk rings. Worn by Egyptian Pharaohs and African traditional rulers in general, Vikings, and medieval knights alike, these statement-making pieces have been adored for centuries. For a new bee in the space of male fashion, rings are the perfect go-to. They’re not intimidating, super easy to style and can be as discreet or loud as you want. And the best part is that they can be easily paired with your favourite watch, bracelet or even cufflinks. Go for comfort: Finding your comfort in little or more is important. Which every way you chose to go, be comfortable with it. As for the fit of your rings, they should be loose enough to easily twist around your finger, but tight enough for it to not slide off every time you wash your hands – it’s all about balance. Balance is key: This is important especially if you are opting for more than one ring. The best thing to do is to have both hands looking balanced, but not necessarily symmetrical. If you choose to wear an oversized ring on the index finger of your left hand, it’ll look more harmonious if you balance that with a couple of simpler rings on your right hand instead of opting for another oversized design. Wear it with confidence: Whether it’s your first time wearing rings or you’ve been rocking them for years, confidence is key. That’s the greatest style secret known to man. It all comes down to confidence. So, play around with your rings until you find a way to style them that works for you and makes you feel confident. So, don’t be afraid to step outside the box and explore the infinite possibilities that men’s jewellery has to offer.
