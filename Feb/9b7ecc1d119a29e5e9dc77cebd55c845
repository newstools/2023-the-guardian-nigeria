Mavin Records princess, Ayra Starr, is back with the same enigma that bagged her the bragging rights she currently enjoys. In her just-released tune dubbed, Sability, the 20-year-old chanteuse delves deeper into her daredevil artistry, crafting a dance floor-ready bop that evokes euphoria and nostalgia. In the song, Ayra Starr starts off building momentum with a street-steeped verse – that is, vague but relatable expressions with average life on the street – before climaxing it with an impressive hook that samples Awilo Logomba’s 1998 classic, Coupé Bibamba. Produced by ace sound whiz, London, the song soars with a very care-free, easy-going, feel-good energy, as Ayra playfully draws references from scenic, mythological and human figures such as ‘Amala Ketu,’ ‘Shinji Kagawa,’ ‘Cele,’ ‘Espiritu Fortuna,’ among others. The song’s strength lies in the masterful delivery of the verses; the hook, sadly, seems to struggle to fit the mood of the record, and might have fared better if performed by the original composer, Awilo Logomba, as a featured act on the song. 
Nonetheless, Sability, is Ayra’s debut song for the year, after a stealthy 2022 that saw her rise to the peak, with hit solos and collabs such as Mavins’ Won Da Mo, Iyanya’s Call, as well as the deluxe version of her debut album, 19 and Dangerous. Sability as the title of the song also portrays the brilliance of her AnR team, by recognizing the potentials of the ‘sabi girl’ concept that Ayra innocently popularised with her debut record and subsequent branding efforts. Sability is out across streaming services.
