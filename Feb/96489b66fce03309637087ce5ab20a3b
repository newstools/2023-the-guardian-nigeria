Chief Magistrate Esther Idowu of Magistrate’s Court II, sitting in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, yesterday, remanded suspected killers of Abeokuta couple, Kehinde and Bukola Fatinoye and their only surviving son, in prison for 60 days. The suspected killers: Adekanbi Lekan, Odetola Ahmed and Adeniyi Waheed, were remanded in Oba correctional center, while their accomplices, Fadairo Temitope and Adekanbi Adenike, were remanded in Ibara Correctional Centre. The suspected buyers of a vehicle stolen from the deceased’s compound, Owolaja Anuoluwapo and Usman Azeez, were also remanded in Oba prison for 60 days. They were brought before the court on an 11-count charge, bordering on murder, conspiracy to commit felony, arson, stealing, escape from lawful authority, amongst others. The remand order for 60 days in the first instance, according to the Chief Magistrate, was pending the legal advice of the Department of Public Prosecution (DPP). Although, the accused persons were not allowed to take their pleas because of the nature of the case, an application for remand was however moved by Oluwatosin Jackson, applicants’ counsel. The couple were murdered in their house located at the Ibara GRA and their corpse set ablaze. The killers also abducted the son of the couple, Oreoluwa Fatinoye and their adopted son, Felix Olorunyomi and threw them into a river. The police had last week paraded, Lekan Adekanbi, the driver of the deceased and two others: Ahmed Odetola and Waheed Adeniyi, for the alleged killing of the couple and their son at the Command’s headquarters, Eleweran, Abeokuta.
