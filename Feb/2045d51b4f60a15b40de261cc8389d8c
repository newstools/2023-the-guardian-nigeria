Former Chairman of Ilana Omo Oduduwa, a Yoruba self-determination body, Wale Adeniran, has renounced his membership in the group. Adeniran in a statement severed ties with the former leader of the group, Prof. Banji Akintoye, saying the latter’s aide accused him of “all imaginable crimes under the sun, the most serious being an allegation of financial impropriety”. Adeniran said he was however not invited to defend himself before any probe panel. He said with effect from Wednesday, February 1, 2023, he ceased to be a “member and an officer of Ilana Omo Oduduwa,” adding that his decision is “irrevocable and irreversible”. He, however, added that he remained “firmly committed to the Yoruba Nation struggle for self-determination”. “I hereby, with effect from today, Wednesday, 1 February, 2023, sever all connections and relationship with Professor Stephen Adebanji Akintoye, the Alana and Chairman of Ilana Omo Oduduwa. “In the meantime, I stepped aside from the Chairmanship and membership of Ilana Omo Oduduwa so as not to be seen to be using my office to influence the work and findings of the probe panel. “On behalf of my family and myself, I hereby express sincere gratitude to friends, colleagues, Yoruba social media presenters and individuals, known and unknown who stood by me and my family during these trying times, and who continually expressed confidence in my integrity. This has been a source of strength to us. “To all Yoruba sons and daughters, I say, do not despair. It is not the time to be despondent. It is the time to come together to do a review, to engage in serious brainstorming, and to re-strategize, within the context of a new, well- structured organization that will be all-inclusive, and focused on Yoruba self-determination.”
