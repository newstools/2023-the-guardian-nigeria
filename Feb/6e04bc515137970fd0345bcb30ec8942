Abubakre who spoke with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) said that this is one of the qualities that make Tinubu best suited to be president of Nigeria. He said that Tinubu, a former Lagos governor, appointed Raji Fashola, Ben Akabueze, Joe Igbokwe and Yemi Osibanjo among others and the personalities had excelled in their service to Lagos State and the nation. The emeritus professor said Tinubu has leadership qualities and the ability of turning challenges into opportunities, as such he is always proactive in his decisions and policies.

“For example, he increased internally generated revenue by many folds when President Obasanjo withheld the local government allocation for Lagos State. “Tinubu is innovative. He embraced innovation to remove ghost workers and ghost positions through effective database management of big and deep data. He also enshrined good governance and respect for the rule of law. “This strengthened institutions and ensured the sanctity of agreements which enhanced ease of doing business and reduced transactional costs allowing businesses to thrive in Lagos,” Abubakre said. He expressed the strong belief that what Tinubu achieved in Lagos as the state governor would be replicated if he is elected president of the country.
