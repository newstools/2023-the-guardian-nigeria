• Customers Move Funds From Traditional Banks
• PoS Charges Inch Toward 50%
• Monetary Experts Demand Further Deadline Extension For Old Notes 
• Say Targeting Politicians Ill-advised 
• CBN Tasked On Expanding New Notes Distribution To MFBs Amid the growing hardship that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) naira redesign policy has inflicted on Nigerians, monetary and economic experts say the situation could lead to a host of negative unintended consequences, which may hit the deposit money banks hard.  In the South East and South South, depositors part with as much as 20 to 40 per cent of the value of a transaction to have access to their savings. In Lagos, where some banks pay customers N1, 000 after spending over an hour in queues, PoS changes seem to have settled for 10 per cent.
  
The Central Bank directed that a customer should be restricted to a daily maximum withdrawal limit of N20, 000. 
  
At a press conference in Lagos on Friday, Emefiele said the amount would increase as the supply of the new notes improved. But no bank currently meets the N20, 000 mark. Hoarding has also sparked as those who have access to cash hold back what they have. This could worsen the situation in the coming weeks.  Mainoma said: “It appears they are trying to enforce the cashless policy, not really the redesign of the naira. If they say they want to stop vote buying, we can still buy votes through transfers. I don’t believe that is the objective.”
