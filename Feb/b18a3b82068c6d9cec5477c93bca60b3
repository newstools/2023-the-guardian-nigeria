Days before the presidential and national assembly elections in the country, the Inspector General of Police, IGP Usman Alkali Baba has approved redeploy of two police commissioners to Kano. The new CPs are Muhammad Yakubu who is replacing CP Dauda Mamman now redeployed to Plateau state and CP Ita Lazurus Uko-Udom. CP Yakubu assumed as substantive and coordinating CP while CP Uko-Udom would monitor Kano central senatorial district. A statement by the spokesperson of the command in Kano, SP Abdullahi Haruna Kiyawa, revealed that three deputy commissioners of police DCP also deployed to man various strategic and hotspot in the state. The new senior officers are DCP Adamu Isa Ngoji and DCP Abdulkadir El-Jamal will supervise Kano South Senatorial District while DCP Abaniwonda S. Olufemi is posted to Kano North Senatorial District for the 2023 General Election. Meanwhile, the new posting came less than 48 hours after one of the opposition New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) raised the alarm of the alleged illegal arrest and detention of over 100 members of its party. The party had threatened mass protest and urged the immediate deployment of CP Dauda Mamman from Kano to guarantee credit and violence-free election in the state. Although, before his sudden redeployment to Plateau state, former Kano CP Mamman has refuted NNPPâ€™s allegations and rather pledged to prioritize the security of life and property, the posting of the new senior officers may not be far from the raging political tension and violence in the last few days.
