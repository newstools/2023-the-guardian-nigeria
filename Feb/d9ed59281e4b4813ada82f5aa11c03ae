<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2007340 lazyload lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Obatala-2-422x598.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="1380" /> The cultural ethos of the Yoruba people conceptualised and crystalised in the single word ‘Omoluabi’ is arguably inspired by one of the first gods in the pantheon, Obatala. The gods in Yoruba mythology are distinctly archetypal. However, a curious look at their delineations will reveal peculiarities steeped in ideals-Obatala is a pacifist. Obatala is an important deity or Orisha in the Yoruba religion. He is worshipped in many parts of southwestern Nigeria, West Africa and the Caribbean.
Obatala has a lot of appeal. He is among the first set of Orisha that descended from heaven; he was present at the dawn of creation, where he played a central role in the flora and fauna of the earth as we know it. So, Who Is He?
While Ogun and Sango are known for their fiery temperament, Obatala is the direct opposite, a pacifist! In popular parlance, one would say Obalata ‘eschew vawulence’. His peace-loving disposition is probably why Olodumare entrusted him with the most crucial task among all the gods-creation. Olodumare tasks Obatala with creating the world and humanity. At the dawn of creation, as soon as Ogun clears a path through primordial chaos, Obatala descends from the heavens on a chain, carrying a snail shell filled with sand and a rooster, which he uses to spread the sand and create the earth. Obatala is often depicted as a wise, elderly figure dressed in white robes and carrying a staff. He is associated with calmness, purity, and self-control and is sometimes known as “the King of Peace. Exploits? Where do we even start? Creation as we know it is Obatala design! He is the architect of what is known as the earth now. Per mythological sources, Obatala is responsible for creating humans-women, men and children; he carves them all. His earliest works are sublime, beautiful, well-proportioned beings. Then tragedy strikes! Obatala accidentally gatecrashes a gods’ party and drinks palmwine. While in his drunken state, he continues to mould humans; unfortunately, the craftsmanship does not reflect the excellence of his earlier effort. Moreover, deformities and disabilities mark his creations during this period of intoxication. Unsurprisingly, Olodumare is displeased and sanctions Obatala. After sobering up, Obatala gives up alcohol and becomes a teetotaler! To this day, true worshippers of Obatala are known for their sobriety and aversion to alcohol. As an act of penance, Obatala becomes the patron god of people living with disabilities. Why Is He Revered?
Obatala is an important figure in Yoruba mythology and is widely revered throughout the Yoruba religious community. His role as a creator, mediator, and association with purity and peace has made him a symbol of wisdom and justice for many people. Cultural anthropologists have drawn many similarities between him and Jesus Christ of Nazareth (as found in the Abrahamic faith); they are both pacifists and are consequently associated with peace and harmony. Obatala and Jesus Christ are also similarly depicted in popular culture; a sagely-looking elderly man adorned in white (We can picture Hollywood veteran, Morgan Freeman playing Obatala in a Netflix flick). For many people, Obatala’s temperament is appealing and significantly more welcoming than any other god. His Status In Pop Culture
Celebration of Obatala is primarily found in visual art. However, Obatala hasn’t received much love in popular culture beyond exotic paintings, sculptures, and prints, especially in Nigeria. Unlike Ogun and Sango, who have had movies and other art forms based on their time and exploits, Obatala hasn’t had the honour. Therefore, there is a valid fear that Obatala’s mythology risks being forgotten outside of active worshippers by the coming generation.
But, curiously, if presented properly, Obatala is likely to be well received by Gen-Z. His penchant for purity can be “aestheticised” as OCD, and his pacifism will find an explanation in horoscope and astrology!
