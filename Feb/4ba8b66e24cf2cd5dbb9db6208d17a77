At least two bodies were reportedly recovered from the ruins of a two-storey building that collapsed at Mbodo, Aluu, Ikwerre Local Council of Rivers State.
 
The incident happened on Friday evening, with more occupants allegedly still trapped in the rubble. According to an eyewitness, Nnam Ebulu, who was within the vicinity when the incident happened, the collapsed building was an annex of a hotel allegedly leaned on a fence bordering a waterlogged property.
 
When The Guardian visited the scene, there was a joint team of emergency responders from the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), and the Nigeria Security Civil Defense (NSCDC).
 
Also, the Chairman of the local council, Dr. Samuel Nwanosike, was seen at the scene, and had mobilised a bulldozer to aid the rescue operation.
  
However, as at press time, there was no official statement on the incident and efforts to reach the spokespersons of the NEMA and NSCDC were not successful.
