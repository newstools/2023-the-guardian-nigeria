Analysts at Cordros Capital said: “In the short to medium term, we expect domestic investors to continue to dominate the market, although election uncertainties and prospects for higher FI yields may constrain buying activities. “Also, FPIs, who have exhibited a lacklustre interest in domestic equities, are likely to remain on the sidelines due to upcoming elections, sustained FX liquidity challenges, and tightening global financing conditions.” Chief Research Officer of Investdata Consulting Limited, said: “We expect mixed and positive sentiments to continue as market players digest January CPI data amid corporate earnings expectations, portfolio rebalancing, falling rates and anxiety over the election uncertainty. “Any pullback at this point may add more strength to upside potential. As such, investors should take advantage of price correction. Also looking at the trends and events across the globe and domestically.” Further breakdown of last week’s transactions showed that a total of 2,895 units valued at N452,808.58 were exchanged in 29 deals compared with a total of 16,674 units valued at N11.9 million transacted last week in 44 deals.
