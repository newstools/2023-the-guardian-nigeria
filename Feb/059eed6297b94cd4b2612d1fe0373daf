There is optimism that the newly constructed Lekki Deep Sea Port will emerge as a game changer for Nigeria’s seaborne trade, as it parades modern facilities amid an improved road network for easy evacuation.  The governor, however, said the project’s second phase would be done in two segments for ease of funding and to reduce the traffic impact of the construction work on commuters.
   
The 18.6km first segment, Sanwo-Olu said, would take off from Eleko to Awoyaya and to critical sections around Majek and Ogidan. The second segment, which is 11km, will kick off at Ogidan to Abraham Adesanya Roundabout.
 
He said: “Inauguration of this road is coming after 40 years the infrastructure was originally constructed as a rural cross-section without drain. Our administration flagged off the reconstruction and upgrading of the Eti-Osa-Lekki-Epe Expressway from the existing two-lane to a three-lane dual carriageway with a reinforced concrete pavement and with a lane in each direction dedicated to trucks to accommodate the envisaged axle loads”
   
“The entire project will set the Lekki-Epe corridor on the path of socio-economic prosperity and progress. This corridor is fast emerging as an urban economic hub. The growth must come with infrastructure investment that will support the development. The infrastructure will not only bring relief to residents plying the road, but it will also ease the transportation of goods while encouraging industrial development in the Lekki Free Zone.”
