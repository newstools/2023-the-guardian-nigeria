Human Rights Advancement Development and Advocacy Centre (HURIDAC), yesterday, urged candidates contesting seats in the Lagos State House of Assembly to place premium on anti-corruption, if elected on March 11. The human rights organisation interfaced with candidates from the All Progressives Congress (APC), Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and Labour Party (LP) for Alimosho, Ajeromi Ifelodun, Kosofe, Mushin and Ikorodu, as well as stakeholders from the constituencies, civil society organisations and the media in a town hall meeting. Executive Director of HURIDAC, Ayodele Ameen, who spoke through the Programme Officer, Alice Babalola, welcomed the participants to the meeting and thanked them for their presence, even as he acknowledged the sponsorship support of CISLAC and MacArthur Foundation, which made the event possible. Chairman of the occasion, Lanre Suraj of Civil Society Network Against Corruption (CISNAC), who was represented by Nelson Ekujumi, appreciated HURIDAC for the innovative and laudable action plan against corruption, which the town hall represents, and for providing a window through which the electorate could hold their representatives accountable for their anti-corruption footprints. However, HURIDAC promised to interface with the constituents and the candidates, so that the anti-corruption plans of the candidates and their party could be used to measure their ability to keep promise when eventually elected.
