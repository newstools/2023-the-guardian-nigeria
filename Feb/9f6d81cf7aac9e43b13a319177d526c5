Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN), on Friday, said that its members were not buying petrol at N172 per litre, as being insinuated. IPMAN’s Chairman, Western Zone, Alhaji Dele Tajudeen, stated this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Ibadan. Tajudeen described the report being circulated that IPMAN members were buying petrol
for N172 per litre as misleading, far from the truth and capable of inciting the public against them. According to him, it is only the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPCL) that is making arrangements for IPMAN members to lift petrol at the official price. He said that the new pricing arrangement had yet to materialise. “We are still expecting the arrangements being made by NNPCL for independent marketers to lift fuel at N172 so that we also can sell at N195 per litre which is the official price. “The report that emanated from some online media that members of the association have commenced lifting of petrol from the Ijegun-Egba tank farm in Lagos at ex-depot price of N172 per litre is not true. “The report, if not quickly debunked, is capable of inciting members of the public against IPMAN members. It is misleading and far from the truth. “We are committed to serving the Nigerian masses in truth and fairness, without taking advantage of them. “While waiting for the government’s agency in charge of petroleum products to come up with its arrangement for independent marketers, we will continue to serve Nigerians in truth,” Tajudeen said.
