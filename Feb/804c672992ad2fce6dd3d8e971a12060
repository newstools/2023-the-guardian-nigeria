The Chairman of Kaduna State Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Reverend Joseph Hayab, has described the broadcast by Governor Nasir el-Rufai, on the redesign of the Naira by the Federal Government as rebellion and an act of treason.
 
It would be recalled that the President, Muhammadu Buhari, last week, in a nationwide broadcast said that Nigerians were free to accept and transact business with the old N200, while the N500 and N1,000 notes were no longer accepted as legal tender.
 
However, in a state broadcast, el-Rufai urged the state citizens to continue to spend the old naira notes, saying that they are still valid as legal tender.  SOKAPU expressed its disappointment over the governor’s stance on the naira swap, saying el-Rufai sounded desperate in his broadcast, as he was unduly emotional, abusive, and spoke with a lot of braggadocios in the typical manner that has been his public engagement.
