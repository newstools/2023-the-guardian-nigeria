Fans of Turkish first division club Fenerbahçe Istanbul have asked the government in the country to resign. The fans chanted “Man, resign!” during their home game against Konyaspir in Istanbul on Saturday night. They spoke of 20 years of lies and fraud, as can be heard on a video shared by the fan platform Tek Yol Fener. Elsewhere, fans chanted, “Government, resign!” The hashtag #Fenerbahçe, under which footage of the chants was shared, was the most discussed topic on Twitter in Turkey on Sunday morning. It was Fenerbahçe’s first game since the devastating earthquake disaster in south-eastern Turkey on Feb. 6 that left tens of thousands dead. Turkish President Recep Erdoğan has been in power for 20 years. After the earthquake, much criticism of the government’s crisis management was voiced. The opposition also accuses Erdoğan of not having prepared the country sufficiently for such an earthquake and of having neglected building supervision. The government rejects the accusations. Turkey is currently in the middle of an election campaign, as parliamentary and presidential elections had been due to take place in June. But Erdoğan announced before the earthquake that the elections would be brought forward to May 14. It is still unclear whether he will stick to this date.
