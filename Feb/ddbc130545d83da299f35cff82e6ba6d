The Cece Yara Foundation has established partnership with Women at Risk International Foundation (WARIF) to operate a satellite clinic and elicit evidence from children exposed to assaults.
  
The partnership will also help to prevent survivors’ exposure to retraumatisation.
  
Speaking on the initiative in Lagos, the Chief Executive Officer, Cece Yara Foundation, Adetutu Ajibodu, said the partnership was necessary for easy access by victim to medical treatment and evaluation.
  
Ajibodu further stated that the collaboration would assist in accelerating dispensation of justice in abuse cases.
  
She said: “ We recognise the importance of partnership with a reputable organisation whose core values align with our own. We have known WARIF to be dependable in this  field of keeping women and children who have suffered assault. It is therefore a pleasure to collaborate with them on this project. The WARIF Satellite Clinic located at CeCe Yara is a strategic implementation to offer medical services. Beneficiaries at the facility will have access to resources and personnel from both WARIF and CeCe Yara. This collective approach will help achieve the vision of a society free of rape, child abuse, and gender-based violence.”
  
Ajibodu said the foundation will continue to partner with WARIF for technical support to train more medical personnel in specialised sexual assault response, use of rape kits, proper documentation of medical report and preservation of evidence.
  
The Centre Manager at WARIF, Dr. Aniekan Makanjuola, explained that the collaboration would ensure that women and children who are survivors of gender-based violence have access to care, forensic examinations and social welfare in Lagos.
