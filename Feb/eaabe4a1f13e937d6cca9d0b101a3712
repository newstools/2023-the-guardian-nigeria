Ogun State Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Mr. Niyi Ijaleye, has attributed the hitches experienced on Saturday to transportation challenge. Ijaleye, who registered his displeasure at the State Collation Centre, Magbon, Abeokuta, yesterday, during the announcement of the presidential election results, blamed the transporters for breaching the agreement earlier reached with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). “There was a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the transporters, but they put their interests above national interest. You must put national interest first in this task of national assignment,” he said. On his part, the Collation Officer, Prof. Kayode Adebowale, said the poll was largely peaceful. Adebowale, who is the Vice Chancellor, University of Ibadan (UI), appreciated the people of the state for their hospitality, noting that the gesture speaks volume about the state. “I was not in the Situation Room, but I was there. I have taken time to speak with people and the report was that the poll was largely peaceful. I can smell commitment from the people, who took the election as a national assignment. “I know that whatever happens, there will be a winner. But whoever wins will not be from Ghana, but a Nigerian, which means we are all Nigerians,” he added.
