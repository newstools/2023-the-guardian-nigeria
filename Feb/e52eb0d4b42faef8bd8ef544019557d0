The Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) says the management of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Ltd. (NNPCL) has allocated petrol to its members directly to ease scarcity. The National President of IPMAN, Chinedu Okoronkwo, confirmed on Tuesday in Lagos, after the IPMAN NEC meeting with NNPCL management. Okoronkwo said the order was given after a closed-door meeting between IPMAN executives and NNPCL management. He said the meeting resolved that IPMAN members should load petrol at NIPCO, MRS and other loading depots. He said the NNPCL management had confirmed that the product had been released to the depots for immediate loading by IPMAN members. He said IPMAN members were encouraged to upgrade their point of sale (POS) to G4 or G5 for payment efficiency. According to him, “Members without POS are also advised to acquire it for efficiency. “The arrangement was in collaboration with NNPCL Retails Ltd. and IPMAN. IPMAN Members are advised to open up their stations and start selling to the public nationwide.” Okoronkwo said IPMAN was a responsible association with over 85 per cent filling stations across the nooks and crannies of Nigeria. He added that lPMAN would, in a few days’ time, load at NIPCO and MRS depots massively for South West and North West parts of the country. Okoronkwo enjoined members who had made payments to commence loading of petrol from the designated depots.
