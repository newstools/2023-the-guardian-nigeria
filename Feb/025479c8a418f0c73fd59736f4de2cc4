The enthusiasm of many voters who came out early on Saturday to vote is being dampened as the officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) have not gotten to some polling units in Ibadan North Local Government Area of Oyo State. As at 8.12 a.m. at Ward 05 Unit 25, New Bodija, voters had trooped out as early as 7.00 a.m. but officers of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) were nowhere to be found. However, security officers were fully on the ground. As at 8.15 a.m., many voters were waiting for INEC officers at Ward 10 Unit 16, Osuntokun Street, Bodija, Ibadan North Local Government Area. Party agents are already on ground. They lamented the late arrival of INEC officials and materials.
