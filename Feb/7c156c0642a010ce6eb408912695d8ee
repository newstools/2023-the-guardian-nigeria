As Nigerian music evolves into different markets, the Drill music genre – a sub-genre of Hip Hop, which sprang up in the UK – is one of the few imported sounds that have caught on strongly across the motherland. With hundreds of Drill songs or its sister genre, Grime, surfacing from the African music scene, a crop of Abuja-based artistes have become the most vibrant poster-boys for the evolving sound. From the heart of the capital city, these audacious musicians are building a laudable legacy for their craft. Interestingly, the uniqueness of their music is far from the fast-paced tempo of Drill sounds; it is actually their blend of relatable concepts with relatable street lingo that gives their records the gritty, action-filled and soulful mien that they carry. Stretching the legacy of this blossoming genre is Afroselecta BBK, who with his brother Laxy BBK, has stepped out with a new tune dubbed, Different P. On the mid-tempo record, the fraternal duo joined forces to create a different vibe where Laxy BBK sings throughout the record. The record is a mellowed swipe, with vague lyricism that points towards self-affirmation and feels more like an interlude than an actual song. However, it is a noteworthy record that showcases the musicians’ depth in making Drill music for the Nigerian and African audience. In a similar vein, Afroselecta BBK has also unveiled another major act from the capital city called Tobii WTW (Tobi with the wave), with another just-released EP dubbed, Afro and The Wave. Hailing from the Northeastern climes of Adamawa, Afroselecta BBK soared into the mainstream, in 2019, with his debut dubbed, AED. He has since then gone on to produce several records and compilations for rap mavericks including Odumodublvck, Laxy BBK, among others.
