There was relative calm in Yenagoa, the Bayelsa State capital and other places, where the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), yesterday, conducted the rescheduled presidential, Senate and House of Representatives elections in 141 polling units. INEC Chairman, Mahmood Yakubu, had postponed elections in the 141 polling units in Yenagoa, over disruption of electoral processes in Wards 4, 6, 8, and 14. The electorate had protested over the non-availability of electoral materials, INEC officials and incomplete ballot papers. Voters in the affected polling units trooped out as early as 8 a.m. to cast their votes after assurance from the INEC headquarters that security has been remobilised. At the Bayelsa Medical University (BMU), located at Imgbi Road, Ompadec, Azikoro, Mike Okpopor and other centres, voting went on smoothly and orderly. However, there were still some people, who could not find their names on the units allocated to them by INEC, while some could not be captured by BVAS. At Mike Okpokpo Street, Unit 27, a former Chief of Staff to a former Governor in the state, Dikivie Ikiogha, said the BVAS failed to accredit him and many others, despite many attempts. He, however, commended the calmness and peaceful way the election was been conducted, given the electoral body a thumb up. Also speaking on the election, the Chairman of the National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN), Mr. Taribo Spiff, urged the youths to continue to be peaceful while the exercise is going on.
