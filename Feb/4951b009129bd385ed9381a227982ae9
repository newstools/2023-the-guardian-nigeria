Tyler Perry took to his Instagram to address the news going around of her death. He wrote, “After I’ve gotten several calls from people giving me their condolences and I didn’t know what they were talking about, I was sent this article that’s going around. I don’t know how she could have died and nobody told me or her. So I called her and asked her was she dead and she said hell no! Can whoever is responsible for this please stop you better be careful when you speak death over a child of God. This woman is loved by millions and you’re hurting a lot of people.
Cassi is fine living her best life with no worries, no cares, no social media, and no drama. She’s waiting to shoot the next season of House of Payne.” Accompanied with his message was an uploaded screenshot of the hoax story with the words “THIS IS A LIE” inscribed on it.
