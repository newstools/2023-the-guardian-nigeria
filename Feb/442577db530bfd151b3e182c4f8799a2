•Decries dearth of import, export due to trade policy of Republic of Benin Despite the economic hardship in the country, the Seme Command of Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) has intercepted fake United States currency worth $6 million, an equivalent of N2.7billion at exchange rate of N460.52 and arrested two suspects conveying the fake currency from Nigeria to the Republic of Benin. The command said the suspects were arrested at Gbaji checkpoint along the Seme corridor on January 31, 2023 and are currently in the Customs’ custody pending prosecution. The Customs Area Controller of the command, Dera Nnadi, while displaying the seized items to journalists, yesterday, said the command also arrested and seized 1,300 by 30 liters jerry can of Premium Motor Spirit also known as petrol, an equivalent 39, 000 litres roughly over one fuel tanker along the creeks. Nnadi said officers of the command in patrol along Gbetrome base, intercepted six Maltese Interna
tional passports with the same picture of a lady bearing different names. The passports displayed to journalists were that of two Senegalese, three Togolese, four Republic of Benin and one Republic of Niger, along with 10 international driving licences of these various countries from two male suspects who are in the custody of the command, pending further investigation. Other items seized by the command include, 55 sacks containing 550 pieces of donkey skin worth N11.3million, agrochemicals and veterinary drugs, among others. Speaking on trade facilitation, the CAC said the command, while still recovering from the effects of the border closure, facilitated the movement of ECOWAS Trade Liberalisation Scheme (ETLS) with 70 trucks with N1.4 million collected. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1989697 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/pms.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/pms.jpg 1280w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/pms-1062x598.jpg 1062w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/pms-640x360.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/pms-320x180.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/pms-278x156.jpg 278w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/pms-556x312.jpg 556w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/pms-515x290.jpg 515w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/pms-1030x580.jpg 1030w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/pms-712x401.jpg 712w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/pms-1424x802.jpg 1424w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/pms-600x338.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" />On baggage declarations, Nnadi said there were 81 with duty amounting to N4.5 million, as items imported under this arrangement include food products and beverages produced within the sub-region. Speaking on decline in import, the Controller said the command recorded only five declarations of import within this period with a total of N13.3 million paid as duty. According to him, the dearth in import is as a result of the trade policy introduced by Republic of Benin, which traders and the Service consider hostile to Nigeria export. On export, Nnadi said the command facilitated 122 trucks bearing 3.770.48 metric tons of made in Nigeria cargo with Free On Board value of N523 million and National Export Supervision Scheme Fes of N2.6 million He said other sources of revenue for the command include fees collected from the auction sales of seized items, especially petroleum products and other perishable items. According to him, the major source of revenue of the command, which is import and export have not been enhanced since the opening of the land borders as directed by the Federal Government, as traders are still bracing with the challenges of having been out of business for over two years. He, however, commended officers of the command for the landmark seizures recorded despite attempts made at bribing them. Also speaking, the Controller of Seme Border Immigration, Michael Dike, said although it is possible to have dual nationality, the multiple identification is that of an international syndicate indulged in criminal behaviour. The Coordinator, National Agency for Food Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) Seme Command, Dr Nurudeen Audu, said the seized agrochemicals and veterinary drugs are substandard and not meant for Nigeria. He said the products do not have expiration date, manufacturing batch number and address of manufacturer, which would have been used to trace the manufacturers in the country of origin.
