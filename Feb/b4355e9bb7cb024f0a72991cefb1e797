The Indigenous People of Biafra, (IPOB) has said the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor, Godwin Emefiele, does not have the resources to fund its activities. IPOB accused the Department of State Services (DSS) of plotting to humiliate Emefiele out of office by making such claims. IPOB’s Spokesman, Emma Powerful, made the remark while denying DSS’ claims of Emefiele funding the separatist group. Powerful described the report credited to the DSS as ‘lies.’ A statement signed by Powerful stated that Emefiele does not have the money to fund IPOB, considering that the group is bigger than him. The statement reads in part: “The attention of IPOB, led by Nnamdi Kanu, has been drawn to the fabricated lies from DSS, accusing Emefiele of funding our organisation.
“For the records, IPOB doesn’t know Emefiele. We just know that he is the man in charge of CBN.
“Emefiele doesn’t have money to finance IPOB, because the group is bigger than him.” Powerful said IPOB is funded by its members across the world. “DSS can’t claim ignorant of this fact, because they have the intelligence unless they want to tell the world that they are incompetent,” he added.
