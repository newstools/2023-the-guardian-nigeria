The All Progressives Congress, (APC) Northwest youth leader, Abdulhamid  Moh’d Oscar has said that Nigerians will vote for the presidential candidate of his party, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu despite the scarcity of Naira and fuel. He said Nigerians clearly understand that the sudden scarcity of currency and fuel was masterminded by some people around president Muhamadu Buhari and the main opposition party, who wanted to prevent APC from coasting to victory in the upcoming general elections. According to him, at this point, Nigerians have become wiser and understood that politics is being played to prevent them from electing who is capable of fixing the country and,  they will vote for Tinubu without money and fuel. Oscar in a statement said “despite all the plots against Tinubu, I am confident that Nigerians across the 36 states will vote for candidates based on their past performance and Tinubu is the best among them. His resume speaks for him. He will surely replicate what he did in Lagos and therefore, this will be an automatic win for him.” “The crises currently experienced by Nigerians were intentionally designed at this time to cause a major disruption in the lives of people, to bring commercial transactions to a halt, in order to pitch people against APC. “They know that they cannot defeat Tinubu now, so they are devising a plan to provoke voters, so they keep protesting and then keep blaming our party. We know there are PDP members in the Aso-rock engineering all this. “How can the  CBN, commercial Banks, and petrol marketers inflict untold hardship on Nigerians all at the same time? For the records, the CBN had the opportunity to swap currencies even before now and they are now even going against their own laws to set a sudden deadline  for old Naira notes in just less than one month to elections.”
