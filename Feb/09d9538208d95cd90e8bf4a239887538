With barely three weeks to the 2023 presidential election, President Mohammadu Buhari has promised to continue his campaign for the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu. President Buhari made the promise yesterday, at the presidential campaign rally in Lafia, Nasarawa State. “By the grace of God, we are going to continue to campaign and we will win. I will continue to campaign for Bola Ahmed Tinubu because he is a true democrat. He is a committed Nigerian and I believe he will give his best to ensure a good Nigeria.” In his remarks, Tinubu said nobody could destroy his relationship with President Buhari, noting that their relationship has spanned over 20 years. “Those who think that there are cracks in our friendship and relationship will continue to be disappointed. Ours is not about individuals, it is about nation building, honesty, integrity and character.” Tinubu thanked the president for taking time out to be with him at the rally.
