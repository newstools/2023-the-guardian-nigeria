   With the presence of representatives of various political parties, security agencies and other stakeholders, the state Resident Electoral    Commissioner (REC), Monday Udoh-Tom, said: “We are here to receive the sensitive materials. The ones that were not available arrived this morning. The Inter Party Advisory Council (IPAC) chairman and others have sighted them”.
 
He added that the last batch of materials were received at about 1 a.m., yesterday, and the materials were confirmed with a checklist attached from the headquarters of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Abuja. “We are good to go, to send the materials to councils so that by today, they will be moved to RACs. We are starting with far-flung councils like Bomadi, Burutu, Patani, Sapele and then, come down until we get to Oshimili South. “We are hoping that everyone will cooperate with us to make everything seamless and fast,” he said. A domestic observer, National Institute of Strategic Studies (NISS), Brig.-Gen. Chukwuemeka Udenya (red), expressed satisfaction with the distribution, saying: “No issues have been raised so far.” Chairman of the state IPAC, Emeka Bidokwu, noted that a credible election begins with distribution of materials. “The election starts here. We were here the other time, but the materials for House of Representatives were not available. But today we have gone in to sight the materials, we have confirmed that all the materials are complete,” he said.
