Disney’s planned live-action adaptation of The Little Mermaid, starring Halle Bailey as Ariel, received a fresh teaser. The titular mermaid meets Jonah Hauer-King as Prince Eric in the 30-second trailer, while Melissa McCarthy’s nasty sea witch Ursula introduces herself with a chuckle. Following the teaser release she wrote on Twitter, “I’m so very excited to continue the #Disney100 celebration with this new look at #TheLittleMermaid just 100 days until it arrives in theaters!” Together with Jacob Tremblay as Ariel’s fish Friend Flounder, Daveed Diggs as the crab Sebastian, and Awkwafina as the bird Scuttle, the film also stars Javier Bardem as Ariel’s father King Triton. McCarthy discussed her eagerness to introduce the renowned Disney villain to audiences in a March interview with media sources. At the moment, she remarked, “I’m so excited to see it in its full glory.  ” she noted that it “was an out-of-body experience” acting in The Little Mermaid, working with [director] Rob Marshall, and playing one of her all-time favourite villains. In describing the making she said that “every single part of that process was amazing and beyond.” Watch the teaser here.
