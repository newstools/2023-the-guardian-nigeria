About 530 petitioners have called for creation of temporary safe accommodation for women and their children, who are victims of domestic violence and abuse.  She would gladly leave the marriage, but she cannot afford to leave her four children behind. 
 
“She requires a place to live to grow her business and raise her house rent and cater for her kids.
“These stories are among the many that exist in the country. Some of these women have died, including gospel singer Osinachi, who was unable to find help. The pandemic has revealed that more women are being abused on a daily basis, and they are dying in silence because there is no temporary place for them to stay.
“There are no government-owned shelter or facilities, particularly in the Federal Capital Territory, where women who have been abused can stay. The Ministry of Women Affairs should be able to provide shelter homes for victims who have nowhere else to go.
“We cannot let these stories continue; we must protect the women and their children. We must compel the Ministry of Women Affairs and other well-meaning corporate bodies to establish safe havens for women who are victims of abusive relationships; women are economic pillars of this country, and we must support them,” the petitioners added.
