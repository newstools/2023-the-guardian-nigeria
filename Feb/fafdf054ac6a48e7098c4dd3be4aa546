Founder and Senior Pastor, Community Reformers Global Ministries, Justify Obi, has advised young boys to embrace self-discovery, acquire IT skills and network to leverage on the digital space. Obi made the call at the third edition of Boys Hangout organised by Kiddies Mirror with the theme:  ‘Purity and power to ending violence against humanity,’ in Lagbasan, Ajah, Lagos. The event attracted boys between the ages of 13 and 17 years from different tribes, backgrounds, classes and cultures. The boys were trained on self-awareness, how to avoid bullying, drugs and smoking. They were also taught how to deploy critical thinking as tools for leadership. Obi, who spoke on ‘IT opportunity for today and the future,’ urged them to explore and develop their potential to the fullest, while emphasising the significance of technology to education and networking. He added that the fast-changing digital space has provided learning opportunities, immediate and future job placement for young people. Obi noted that technology has increased access to education for children in urban areas and communities, as there are now numerous innovative means to deliver it. A consultant and child’s right expert, Mr. Imoleayo Anthony-Obi, advised the boys against cultism, gang violence and crime, among others. He cautioned them against drugs and smoking substances, which could truncate their dreams, and also canvassed strict legislation against rape and sexual harassment. Life coach and leadership expert, Mr Bolaji Oniyide, who spoke on ‘Discovering the leadership in you,’ taught the boys inter and intra-personal skills. He said critical thinking could help the boys develop new skills and identify some skills they do not have. Coordinator, Kiddies Mirror, Felicia Owolo, appreciated sponsors and other partners, for their contribution toward making the event a success.
