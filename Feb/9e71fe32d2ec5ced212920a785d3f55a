24 teams across the country were able to meet the February 15 deadline for the registration of clubs for the maiden Lagos Athletics Club Series. The tournament, which is a four-leg event, will begin its first leg at the Yaba College of Technology (YABATECH) Sports Complex tomorrow. According to the Technical Director, Lagos State Athletics Association (LASAA), Enefiok Udo-Obong, the 24 teams that met the criteria for the registration will compete at the one-day championships while there are opportunities for more teams to join in the second leg. He however said that athletes from Togo and Benin Republic have decided to team-up with their Nigerian counterparts to form teams for the championship. “We are excited with the turnout of teams for the championships that at the end of the deadline, 24 teams have been confirmed for the take-off this Sunday and for us we are excited with the huge interest in the tournament. We hope to start early and by 5pm, we should be done,” he said. “The aim of the tournament is to ensure we engage our athletes and we also want them to compete as a team. Our aim goes beyond winning but we want to unearth new talents that will represent the country in major competition. We have also secured the approval of the World Athletics (WA) in recognizing some records expected to be set at the tournament.” Board member, LASAA, Dr Modupe Ogunbanjo, tasked the athletes to keep away from doping, as there are no short cuts to success in life. “We are concerned with the welfare of our athletes and this will remain our priority. We know we cannot meet all their needs but we will try our best. But we must also warn them to keep off performance enhancing drugs that will jeopardise their career as well as tarnish their image across the globe,” she said.
