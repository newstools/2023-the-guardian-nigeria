As one of the world’s most prestigious and authoritative design awards, this award means that the TECNO PHANTOM X2 Pro Eco-friendly edition has been recognized by international professional judges and the industry in terms of sustainability, technological and innovative aspects of the design concept. It is the world’s first smartphone to feature a retractable portrait lens comparable to a professional camera to create “studio-like” portrait photography. With a 65mm focal length and 2.5x optical zoom retractable portrait lens, the PHANTOM X2 Pro 5G revolutionizes smartphone image-making. The trailblazing smartphone also packs a powerful flagship MediaTek Dimensity 9000 5G chip, delivering outstanding performance and advanced power efficiency. On top of its exceptional processing power, the PHANTOM X2 Series also has a unibody curved-screen design that softens the phone’s appearance and feels. At the same time, its 3.5D lunar crater back cover reduces the impact of the camera module, eliminating sharp corners and giving it a beautiful, slimmer look. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone  wp-image-1996220 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Tecno-Phantom-X2-Series-Face-Down-Feature-Image.jpg" alt="" width="1412" height="793" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Tecno-Phantom-X2-Series-Face-Down-Feature-Image.jpg 650w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Tecno-Phantom-X2-Series-Face-Down-Feature-Image-640x359.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Tecno-Phantom-X2-Series-Face-Down-Feature-Image-320x180.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Tecno-Phantom-X2-Series-Face-Down-Feature-Image-278x156.jpg 278w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Tecno-Phantom-X2-Series-Face-Down-Feature-Image-556x312.jpg 556w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Tecno-Phantom-X2-Series-Face-Down-Feature-Image-515x290.jpg 515w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Tecno-Phantom-X2-Series-Face-Down-Feature-Image-712x401.jpg 712w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Tecno-Phantom-X2-Series-Face-Down-Feature-Image-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1412px) 100vw, 1412px" /> PHANTOM X2 Pro 5G Eco-Friendly Edition Aimed to celebrate sustainable and smart designs from various disciplines, the IDA serves as an important spotlight for the winning designers and the environmental impact their products have on the world. Committed to the cause, the PHANTOM X2 Pro 5G Eco-Friendly Edition was built with sustainability, featuring an ultra-thin eco-friendly back cover constructed using recycled materials recovered from oceans.
