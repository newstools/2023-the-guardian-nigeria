Labour Party presidential campaign council has debunked a claim that the Oba of Lagos, Rilwan Akinolu, barred the party’s presidential candidate, Peter Obi, from visiting the royal palace during a campaign rally in Lagos on Saturday. The director-general of the LP presidential campaign council, Akin Osuntokun, in a statement on Monday said that a press release with the claim was deceptive and did not come from him. “The said deceptive release claimed, among other things, that ‘We informed Oba of Lagos that Peter Obi wanted to come and pay homage to him before our rally in Lagos, but Oba said that we should not come’,” Osuntokun said. “The fictitious release further claimed that Oba’s reason for not wanting to meet with Peter Obi was that ‘Oba is not interested in seeing another presidential candidate except Bola Tinubu.” Osuntokun stated that he never had such a conversation with the Oba of Lagos or any of his representatives and therefore urged the public to disregard the press release. “I wish to clearly state that the fictitious release did not emanate from me, and I never had such a conversation with the revered Oba of Lagos or any of his representatives. Please disregard the release at whatever it represents. “Henceforth, please disregard any other release that does not originate from our campaign’s official communication channels.”
