Sen. Attan Achonu, chieftain of the Labour Party in Imo State, has called on the electorate from the South East States to ignore the alleged, “no election order” in the region issued by the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB for the Saturday poll. Achonu who represented Okigwe zone in the Red Chamber, made the call while interacting with newsmen, today on his arrival to the state for Saturday’s poll. He insisted that those behind the order are being sponsored by miscreants who do not mean well for the people and the nation at large. Achonu also urged the Igbos to garner their votes for the LP Presidential candidate, insisting that Obi has the capacity, credibility and integrity to salvage the country when elected. He stressed that only Obi’s victory will guarantee the release of the detained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. “We all want Nnamdi Kanu alive. And if we don’t elect someone like Peter Obi, Kanu may not come there alive,” he said. According to him, “Nigerians should see Mr Peter Obi as the only hope to rescue the country from the hands of bad leadership. Mr Peter Obi remains the only candidate among others capable of getting Nigeria to work again. “Nigeria is at the precipice now. We need somebody like Mr Peter Obi to save us now. So It’s time to liberate the country from these leaders that do not have the interest of the masses at heart through our voting.”
