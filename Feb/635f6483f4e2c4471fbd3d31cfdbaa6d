The emergence of “Ponzi Scheme” in the annals of investment’s Lexicon albeit a globally notorious phenomenon, was not a recent development. Its historical antecedent was set in motion with the celebrated Charles Ponzi scheme which came to the fore in the 1920s. Perhaps, it may not be trite to assert that the scheme slipped quietly into the financial eco-system without any inkling on the part of its preys that the strategic initiatives of Charles Ponzi were disguised by investments jiggery-pokery.  After a thorough and detached analysis of the scheme, the following factors may have galvanized the interests of its patrons in our own economic milieu. Firstly, there is lack of due diligence on the part of investors. Most of the Nigerian investors who usually get their fingers burnt via Ponzi schemes fail to do proper due diligence in their investment activities. The legal maxim of “caveat emptor” (Buyers beware) holds sway here. Most investors who fall victims of the Ponzi scheme do not ask pertinent questions such as: what is the track record of the company promoting the scheme? What is their business model? Are they into manufacturing or playing in the service sector? Who are the key members of the Board? Are there key Central Bank of Nigeria’s (CBN’s,) Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC’s,), approvals or licences for the scheme? What is the purpose for which funds are being raised? Is it a debt or equity instrument? Is there a cap or ceiling on the money being raised? What is the return on the investment (ROI)? Is 20% per month (ROI) or 240% per annum under an inclement economic climate like ours realistic? Is the company rated by any of the reputable rating agencies such as Fitch, Moddy or even our own Augusto? Once these and other posers cannot be satisfactorily answered, then, there is a red flag and it is incumbent on the investor to be circumspect.
