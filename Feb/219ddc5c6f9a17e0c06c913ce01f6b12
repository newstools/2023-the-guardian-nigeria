The Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) has appealed to candidates of political parties to think more of Nigeria as the nation awaits results of Saturday elections. The group’s Director, Prof. Ishaq Akintola, made the call in a statement issued in Lagos on Monday. Akintola urged all candidates to avoid inflammable statements and to demonstrate faith in the country’s electoral system. The organisation further urged politicians and their followers to eschew post-election violence and to seek redress in the court of law, if aggrieved. “Nigerians went to the polls on Saturday, Feb. 25, to pick their 16th president, senators and representatives. “As at today, Monday, Feb. 27, the results are still coming in trickles. “But already, there have been pockets of violence in a few places around the country, although this has not been widespread and they have been contained. “MURIC appeals to all candidates in the 2023 general elections to think more of Nigeria now and in the next few weeks,” he appealed. He said that elections weighed heavily on contestants and the tendency is for emotions to run high among supporters. “True democrats, responsible contestants and patriotic candidates are usually identified by the way they control their sentiments and how they guide their supporters towards actions capable of stemming tension. He warned that the international community was waiting by the ringside, adding that Nigeria must not be turned into a caricature of democracy and a laughing stock in the committee of nations. “Neither should any candidate attempt to burn the bridge after crossing it because the lives of more than 200 million Nigerians are at stake. “Therefore, candidates should realise that Nigeria is bigger than all the contestants put together,” he said.
