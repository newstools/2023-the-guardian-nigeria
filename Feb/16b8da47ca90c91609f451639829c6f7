Reports indicate that AKA was the target of a drive-by shooting that took place outside the Wish Restaurant on Florida Road. The rapper was planning to celebrate his birthday at the YUGO nightclub in Stamford Hill that evening. In addition to AKA, his bodyguard was also injured in the shooting, and another close friend of the rapper was killed. AKA was born and raised in Cape Town and rose to prominence with the release of his single “Victory Lap,” which was featured on his debut album Altar Ego in 2011. He gained a following in Nigeria as well, thanks to his hit single “Fela in Versace.”
