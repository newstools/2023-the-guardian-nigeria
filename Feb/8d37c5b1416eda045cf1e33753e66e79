PIX: TWITTER. All Progressives Congress (APC), Manchester Chapter, United Kingdom, has expressed its resolve to ensure the victory of the party’s presidential flag bearer, Bola Tinubu and his vice, Kashim Shettima, as well as Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s re-election in the coming elections.
 
In a statement, yesterday, the diaspora group, comprising of many affiliations, gave the assurance at the weekend during their convergence in London.
   
The Spokesperson of the Nigeria Diaspora for Asiwaju (NDA Manchester), David Adeoye, explained that the convergence was borne out of the fact that for the first time in history, the presidential candidate emerged, though rancorous but overwhelming, and given their culture in the diaspora to show much concern and affinity with what goes on at the home front, their total loyalty to ensuring a functional country remains sacrosanct.
 
He added that they have started galvanising a support base for Asiwaju since the commencement of the Permanent Voter cards (PVCs) registration exercise, due to their firm belief that Tinubu can overhaul the nation’s economy and all aspects of citizens’ lives for the better.
