Irked by the difficulties in getting cash following the Federal Government’s new monetary policy, youths in Sagamu on Monday attacked two banks destroying properties. The protesters who had earlier gathered in front of the palace of the Akarigbo of Remoland, Oba Babatunde Ajayi, set up barricades on major roads thereby disrupting the free flow of traffic. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the protesters later marched on the two commercial banks at Ijoku in Sagamu destroying properties. A youth leader in the town, Mr Kayode Segun-Okeowo, described the act as a “motivated destruction and not a protest.” “This is not a protest. I’m a comrade and understand the ABC of protest. It’s motivated to cause destruction. “Those behind this must stop,” he told newsmen. Segun-Okeowo also confirmed that two commercial banks were vandalised by the protesters. When contacted, the State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Abimbola Oyeyemi , confirmed the incident, but said that the situation had been brought under control. ” The Commissioner of Police, Frank Mba is personally leading combine team of policemen and some military men to tackle the situation . ” We are right there as am talking to you now ,” Oyeyemi said.
