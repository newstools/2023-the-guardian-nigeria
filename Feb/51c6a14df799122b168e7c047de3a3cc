The Nigerian Army has approved a list of hotlines to report any suspicious act of violence by unscrupulous persons during the forthcoming general election. The Director, Army Public Relations, Brig.-Gen. Onyema Nwachukwu made this known in a statement on Tuesday in Abuja. Recalled that the Nigerian army had earlier produced and circulated Codes of Conduct and Rules of Engagement for Operation Safe Conduct to its formations and Units. The manual is to provide guidance and ensure that troops operate within the provisions of the law. Nwachukwu said the hotlines were to afford members of the public, the opportunity to support the efforts of security agencies in ensuring peaceful elections across the country. He said the hotlines were also released to report the conduct of troops deployed to provide security during the election. This, according to him, is part of the Nigerian army’s move to support the police, which is the lead security agency, to ensure the successful conduct of free, fair and peaceful elections. “Members of the general public are please enjoined to call the phone numbers below in their various states including the Federal Capital Territory Abuja to report any security breach during the elections: ABIA STATE 08031113129 ADAMAWA STATE 08022750987 AKWA-IBOM STATE 07034470916 ANAMBRA STATE 07035891185 BAUCHI STATE 08128063675 BAYELSA STATE 08033241005 BENUE STATE 08080754339 BORNO STATE 09099616160, 08086987079 CROSS RIVER STATE 08037084192 DELTA STATE 07035070797 EBONYI STATE  08158274048 EDO STATE  09066325953 EKITI STATE  08037851448 ENUGU STATE 09032102212, 08023097458 GOMBE STATE  07063908779, 08082557782 IMO STATE  07034907427 JIGAWA STATE  07017791414, 08100144363 KADUNA STATE 07031544227, 08028580978, 08035242633 KANO STATE  08038432656 KATSINA STATE 08108854061, 09012998054 KEBBI STATE  09130213661 KOGI STATE  08033217964 KWARA STATE  09060001270 LAGOS STATE 08034025825, 08023190487, 09024409000 08033709434 NASSARAWA STATE 09051009404 NIGER STATE  07031346425 OGUN STATE  09116589494 ONDO STATE  08036130535 OSUN STATE  09019683922 OYO STATE  07047703000 PLATEAU STATE  08037116395, 07031260622 RIVERS STATE  08064274222 SOKOTO STATE  07069084570, 07052693532, 08136913284 TARABA STATE  08136728969, 08060902363 YOBE STATE  08061397656 ZAMFARA STATE  08140075541 FCT  09114913164, 08186690471, 08079153860, 08034276240, 08164304255, 09159793968.
