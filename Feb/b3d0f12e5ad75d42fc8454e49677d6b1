In appreciation of their unwavering support, lawmaker for Oshodi-Isolo Federal Constituency 2 of Lagos State in the House of Representatives, Ganiyu Johnson, has empowered 512 artisans and petty traders in Isolo and Ejigbo areas of the state. The programme was in collaboration with the Cocoa Research Institute of Nigeria and Faiazazeem Nigeria Limited. Addressing the constituents, Johnson reiterated his commitment to the residents of Oshodi-Isolo Federal Constituency 2 on democracy dividends. He said the residents needed to be supported and empowered in a way to be self-reliant to overcome the strains of hardship.  His words: “If you give a man fish, you have just given a single meal; but if you teach him to fish, he will eat throughout his lifetime.” The lawmaker further explained the need to rekindle hope in the people and encourage them to be proactive in the fight against poverty, adding that it was imperative to help his constituents, who had been struggling to start businesses of their own due to limited or unavailable resources at their disposal. While admonishing his constituents to learn a trade to benefit from his empowerment programmes, he said: “Hard time does not last and the antidote of poverty is hardwork.” Items distributed at the programme include: 10 tricycles, 60 refrigerators, 65 sewing machines, 42 hair dryers, 30 grinding machines, 35 ovens and 55 generators. Also, 85 constituents were supported with N50,000 cash each to boost their trades. One of the beneficiaries, Ajibola Yusuf, said Johnson had changed the narrative of Oshodi/Isolo Federal Constituency politics to progressive one, describing the gesture as unprecedented. He urged all public office holders to borrow a leaf from the lawmaker.
