A Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO), South Saharan Social Development Organisation (SSDO), has launched zero election violence campaign, saying it is to educate and sensitise the electorate on need to shun all forms of electoral violence during the 2023 general elections. The organisation said it decided to embark on the campaign, following the fact that electoral violence had continued to characterise every election season in Nigeria. It also stressed that it was poised to change the narrative. The group said: “We shall create and institutionalise a unique hand symbol and popularise the hashtag, #ZeroElectionViolence, across social media platforms. We will end the campaign with a mega rally to have a well-rounded effect. “While executing Project 100-Rural Election Drive, we got disturbing feedback of election-related violence from town criers in some communities, which have been a burden in the country’s political space since its return to democratic rule. “In certain communities, town criers were chased, embarrassed and prevented from disseminating information in their communities. We realised that this had been an age-long challenge.” “In a survey, we sampled public opinions and realised that 67 per cent of people believe the coming general elections will be marred by violence.”
