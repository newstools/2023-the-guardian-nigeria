In view of the importance attached to the upcoming Presidential Election, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has dedicated its Consumer Toll-Free Number 622, to serve as 2023 Presidential Election Incident Hotline to enable voters and members of the public across Nigeria to report any issues that may affect them, or others, during the elections on February 25. This step is to support the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), in its patriotic commitment, towards the conduct of hitch-free elections in Nigeria. In a notice signed by the Executive Vice Chairman, NCC, Prof. Umar Danbatta, the toll-free number 622 is the second-level complaints centre through which consumers of telecommunications services are allowed to make calls directly to the Commission, to resolve issues concerning their telecommunications services, which the service providers are unable to do. However, NCC said in consideration of the critical nature of this election and to alleviate emergent issues that may arise at the voting centres, or any parts of Nigeria thereof, it (commission) has considered it expedient to dedicate the toll-free number 622 to accommodate all types of complaints on Election Day. The commission said this is with a view to resolving such issues by contacting and conveying such to relevant agencies, authorities, or organisations for timely resolution. The telecoms regulator said the 622 Election Incident Monitoring Centre would be manned by top management officials of the NCC. It added that the hotline is open to the public from 8.00 a.m. to 6.00 p.m. during the Presidential and National Assembly elections. NCC urged members of the public invited to take advantage of the Election Incident Monitoring Centre Hotline, 622.
