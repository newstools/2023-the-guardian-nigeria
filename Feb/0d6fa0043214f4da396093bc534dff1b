Ahead of the forthcoming general elections in Enugu State, the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state, Dr. Peter Mbah, has called on churches to partner with him in his journey to create better welfare, improve standard of living of the people, and empower youths, women and vulnerable ones through employment generation, training in digital skills and vocational acquisition. Mbah made this call, yesterday, at Emene during the final day of a 40-day prayer and fasting retreat organised by the Catholic Charismatic Renewal of Nigeria (CCRN), and at Ugwuaji, at the 48th Synod of the Methodist Church of Nigeria, held at Luke Methodist Church, where he was invited as a guest of honour to address them, even as crowd of worshipers assured him of their support and votes on election day. While addressing the mammoth crowd of Catholic worshipers, Mbah recalled his robust relationship with the church and how he was infused with discipline, purity of character and universal ideas of moral values, hard-work, resilience, dedication and diligence in pursuing his dreams in life. He enjoined churches across the state to partner with him to displace those forces working against the good things that are about to happen to the state by voting en masse for him and other PDP candidates in the state. He also called for partnership with the people for the empowerment of youths, women and vulnerable in the society through adequate training in entrepreneurship, technology, digital skills and investment in Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) through availability of N100 billion revolving fund that will be made available to assist youths in setting up their own businesses as proposed in his manifesto. He appealed to the gathering, made up of youths, to vote for him as the right candidate that will give them reasons to celebrate by turning the economy around through his integrated development programmes and disruptive innovation that will turn them into productive assets, wealth creators and employers of labour. Addressing the Methodist Synod, Mbah appreciated the people for their uncommon faith and trust in the PDP over the past 23 years through their continual votes, stressing that the PDP had responded positively through massive infrastructure both in urban and rural areas, and had also provided an atmosphere of peace and tranquility where citizens could operate without fear.
