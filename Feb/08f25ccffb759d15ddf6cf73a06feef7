The hope sports enthusiasts have of seeing the National Stadium back as the centre of sports excellence seems to have been dashed by vandals, who for two weeks, have had unfettered access to the facility’s cables. A local website, newstap.com.ng., reported, yesterday, that in less than two weeks, the thieves have stolen cables and batteries of the generator at the back of the Indoor Sports Hall of the stadium and also the batteries of the generator and cables serving the main bowl of the Stadium. Following the series of unchecked vandalisation of the stadium’s property, the management has been forced to start renting generators to power facilities at the Indoor sports hall. According to the report, the incidents were not discovered until some days after the robbery. With a police station inside the stadium and the presence of a private security outfit employed by the Ministry of Youth and Sports to secure the facility, observers say it is a mystery how these cables and generators were taken out of the stadium without detection. Reacting to the incident, Sports Ministry’s Lagos Liaison Officer, Nkana Mbora, said she is still taking inventory of the vandalised items and would not make any statement now. However, the stadium’s management has started restricting the movement of people in and out of the stadium.
