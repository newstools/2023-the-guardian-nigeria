Ondo State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC), yesterday, ordered the immediate suspension of rallies by all its structures across the state. According to the Chairman, Ade Adetimehin, the move became imperative to empathise with residents of the state over the current currency and fuel crises in the country. A statement signed by the Publicity Secretary, Alex Kalejaye, reads: “The party has directed its chairmen and directors-general at all levels, within the chapter, to suspend rallies, in sympathy with our people.” The party chieftain regretted that the country was experiencing unusual hike in the pump price of petrol and shortage of cash a few weeks away from “an all-important general elections.” Adetimiehin argued that “the people of Ondo have the right to be angry” and express same over the unfortunate development, but urged them to behave as patriots that believe in a better tomorrow. “As a party, we identify with our people at this unpleasant period. We agree they are exercising their rights, but urge them to do so with measure of restraint. Our strong belief is that this time shall fade soon,” he added He acknowledged the tireless efforts of the Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu-led administration to ameliorate the harsh situation, and ensure security of residents of the Sunshine State.
