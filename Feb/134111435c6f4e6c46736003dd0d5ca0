Urge youths, electorate to vote wisely Kinsmen of the National Chairman of the All Progressives Grand alliance (APGA), Victor Oye, and a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Anambra State, Jeff Nweke, have thrown their weight behind the aspiration of the Senator representing Anambra Central Senatorial District, Uche Ekwunife, to emerge the next Senate president. Oye’s kinsmen, including former Minister of Women Affairs, Josephine Anenih, and President General of Amawbia Town Union, as well as one-time Director General of Standard Organisation of Nigeria (SON), Ike Odumodu, described Ekwunife’s performance in the National Assembly as unequalled. They observed that she is the only Senator, who organised town hall meetings to keep her constituents abreast of what she does in the National Assembly.  They added that Ekwunife has shown that a legislator does not only make laws, but empowers constituents, provides jobs and attracts projects, including road construction. While urging youths and the electorate to vote for PDP candidates in the coming elections, they noted that Ekwunife is a ranking Senator, a development that brightens her chances of becoming the next Senate President.
