She said, “When a witch has a coven, it’s normally a small thing. Witch’s covens are normally three to seven people,” she says. “When it becomes thousands, it’s called a hive. Y’all a part of that lady Beyhive? And you call yourself a Christian? May the dealings of the Lord come upon you.” The Houston based pastor did not go free on her remarks as she faces criticism for her remarks from loyal “Beyhive”. Following the discovery of a tweet from 2014 in which Montgomery gushed about attending a Beyoncé concert, some detractors have accused her of being hypocritical. Montgomery, though, claims that happened before she was saved. Tiphani Montgomery has said that she has “never claimed to be a pastor”. She however shares her preaching to more than 100,000 YouTube subscribers. In a recent a message titled “Altered at the Altar,” Tiphani Montgomery talks to Christians about Beyoncé concerts, asking them not to attend. “I rebuke you in the name of Jesus; how dare you call yourself a Christian. I don’t care what pastor you got who’s okay with it. I don’t care what pastor you got that think it’s cool. I don’t care what pastor you got that sing along to the songs because they want some clout.”
