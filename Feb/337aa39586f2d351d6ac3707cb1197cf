Africa Network for Environment and Economic Justice (ANEEJ) has applauded the bilateral agreement between the Federal Government and United States for the repatriation of $954,807 recovered from the late former governor of Bayelsa State, Diepreye Alamieyeseigha. The Executive Director, Rev. David Ugolor, who gave the commendation at the signing ceremony, yesterday, in Abuja, pledged that his organisation would work closely with the Federal Ministry of Justice, Bayelsa State government and the United States government in ensuring judicious deployment of the loot for the benefit of the people. He said: “We have worked with the Bayelsa State NGOs Forum (BANGOF) to organise stakeholders’ meetings in the past, where it was decided that the money should be channelled to improving primary healthcare facilities in the state.”	as enshrined in the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) and Global Forum on Asset Recovery (GFAR) principles. This is against the initial proposal for building of judges’ quarters proposed by the previous administration in the state. We are glad that the effort has yielded expected result.” It could be recalled that Alamieyeseigha and various companies linked to him were convicted in Nigeria for criminal conduct.
