A Federal High Court in Enugu has fixed February 15 for judgment in the suit seeking disqualification of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate, in Enugu State, from taking part in the 2023 general elections. The Enugu North Senatorial District candidate of the African Democratic Congress (ADC), Chika Idoko, filed the case. In the suit No: FHC/EN/CS/217/202, Idoko had dragged Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), PDP and its candidates in the state to court. He had claimed that the PDP primary, held last year, was in contravention of Section 77 of the Electoral Act, and, therefore, should be voided. He added that the party should be punished in line with extant provisions of Section 84 of the same act. After listening to arguments, the Judge, Justice Folashade Giwa-Ogunbanjo, adjourned the suit to February 15 for ruling on preliminary objection and judgement on the substantive suit.
