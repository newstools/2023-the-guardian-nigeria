Governor Nyesom Wike has, contrary to his earlier position, approved Adokiye Amiesimaka Stadium for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential rally holding on Saturday, February 11 in Port Harcourt.  The governor also flayed the claim by the National Chairman of the PDP, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, on Monday, that they were reaching out to the G-5 governors and that one of the G-5 governors visited him in his residence. Wike insisted that neither he nor any of G5 governors visited Ayu’s residence. “Nobody can blackmail us. We’ll never go and meet anybody. We are who we are. This is not the first time we have battled. This battle we will win at the end of the day.” Campaigning for Sir Siminialayi Fubara, Wike said the consolidation team would continue with his development strides and consolidate on the gains made by him.
