Founder, Wives roundtable Foundation, Amaka Chibuzo-Obi, while speaking at the event in Surulere, Lagos, disclosed that the project aims to empower women positively in the digital spaces, impact the family, improve the society and boost the economy.
   
At the second edition of the ICT programme, which was intensive and free of charge to all participants, Obi said the two-day training was borne out of a desire to help middle aged women to become tech savvy and assist themselves and children to be relevant in the social media.
  
She added that the training would boost both their on -line and off line businesses, confidences and ensure they never remain stuck to their existing businesses.
   
She also added that the àim was also to make a decent living and earn money to enable them to gain financial freedom. Victor Anyanwu, the Oracle social media trainer and consultant, taught the women about several usage of social media platforms Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, among others and told them to showcase all their businesses and services on the platforms.
   
The participants had introductory classes in areas of their interest and were taught different skills for startups and to keep existing businesses afloat especially during the economic downturn.
   
They were also exposed by the Foundation to business plans, registration, and adverts on social media, business trafficking and optimisation.
