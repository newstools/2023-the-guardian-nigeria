Immediate past Director General of the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), Dr. Dakuku Peterside, has challenged Governor Nyesom Wike to name his presidential candidate as he had promised to do before January ends. The APC chief described Wike as “lacking courage, tact, reason and finesse.” Peterside, in a statement, yesterday, in Port Harcourt, alleges that “Wike avoids difficult conversations, lacks vision and pursues personal interest above people’s interest. I dare Wike to tell the people the presidential candidate he is supporting if he is a man. He had promised his fans that he will unveil his candidate latest January but he lacks the courage to take a position,” Dakuku said. He described the governor as a multidimensional failure in governance, whose major accomplishment is investment in media to create false impression to hide his ineptitude in good governance delivery, nepotism and crude politics. The APC chief further condemned attacks on campaign grounds of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Opobo/Nkoro Council of the state. The Guardian gathered that some suspected political thugs had invaded APC Rally in the area, wreaking havoc.
