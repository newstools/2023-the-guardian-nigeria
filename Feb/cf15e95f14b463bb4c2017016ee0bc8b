On the other hand, for some people, this is also a day of questioning your existence “God when???” “Am I a potato?” “Omo! this life no balance at all,” and the list goes on. Yes, I know being single on this love-centric day can be very dreadful. But here’s what most people choose not to know: Valentine’s Day isn’t just for couples; it’s for everybody. There is no need to feel sad or under any pressure, if you are single on this day, but you can also consider genuinely enjoying this day without a significant partner by finding other ways to honour other relationships in your life, for example, by celebrating Galentine’s Day and Friendsgiving. However, if we choose to spend the “Love Day” let’s consider loving ourselves, our friends, our families, and our communities. Like they always say, “believe that the arrow of love is already on its way to a wonderful and unknown future, that is full of all kinds of love, a future that is unique to you” until then being single on valentine’s day is not a crime and that is why we’ve compiled a list of fun activities to celebrate the heart-shaped holiday.

Invest in yourself, spoil yourself, and make yourself happy. Go for a SPA treatment: a facial, a massage, a mani-pedi, a haircut, your lashes done, your nails fixed, and so on.

You do not need to go to your favourite restaurants with a lover; you can always go and explore alone. Solo dates are underrated. Solo dates not only help you reconnect and spend quality time with yourself, but they also help you try out different foods and concentrate without being distracted. You can take pictures and make videos of yourself without stress. People toasting drinks in bar | Konbini Go out with friends Valentine’s day is also a good day to connect with your friends. You might not be the only single one among your friends. You can plan a date with your friend, eat together, go shopping, go to karaoke, go paintballing, and so on. Such a date will help strengthen the friendship bond, and who knows? You might find your true love outside. Inside a theatre Go to a movie
Going to the movies alone is better than going with someone else. This will help you concentrate and enjoy the movie without distractions. Get yourself a ticket to the movie you have been dying to see, get popcorn and a drink or snacks, and enjoy your movie. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-621803 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/o-GREEN-WORKOUT-facebook.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1000" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/o-GREEN-WORKOUT-facebook.jpg 2000w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/o-GREEN-WORKOUT-facebook-1062x531.jpg 1062w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/o-GREEN-WORKOUT-facebook-487x244.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/o-GREEN-WORKOUT-facebook-974x487.jpg 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/o-GREEN-WORKOUT-facebook-320x160.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/o-GREEN-WORKOUT-facebook-640x320.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/o-GREEN-WORKOUT-facebook-600x300.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /> Sweat it Out with a Workout Treating Valentine’s Day as a normal day can help reduce sadness and oppression from other couples.
