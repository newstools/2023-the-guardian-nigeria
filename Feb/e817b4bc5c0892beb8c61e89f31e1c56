As the private sector-led Coalition Against COVID-19 (CACOVID) winds down, President Muhammadu Buhari has commended the initiative for elevating his status among presidents of the world. The President spoke in Abuja, yesterday while receiving a parting donation of N12 billion for security equipment from CACOVID. Items handed over to the President by the Coalition’s members included 100 Tata 14 ton troop carriers, 100 Tata 12 ton troop carriers, 86 Toyota pick-up trucks, 64 Nissan Navara pick-up trucks with their spare parts, 13,000 helmets as well as 13,000 bullet proof vests	. It would be recalled that the World Health Organisation (WHO) rated CACOVID as the third largest contributor in the world to the fight against COVID-19, the outbreak of which, in 2020, brought the world to its knees. An excited Buhari, while thanking CACOVID on behalf of the military and the police, said: “Today is indeed a very happy day for all Nigerians, and I can happily say that I am the envy of many Presidents in the world. “I am exceedingly honoured to be the President and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, at this time.” Speaking, while handing over the items, Chairman of the Aliko Dangote Foundation (ADF), Aliko Dangote, a foremost industrialist who initiated the Coalition with the Group Managing Director of Access Bank Plc, Herbert Wigwe, explained that the Coalition was winding down with the latest donation. He listed other business leaders brought together under CACOVID as Mrs. Folorunsho Alakija, Tony Elumelu, Jim Ovia, Segun Agbaje, Abdulsamad Rabiu, Femi Otedola, Adesola Adedotun, Karl Toriola, Haresh Aswani, Raj Gupta, and John Coumantaros, all of who contributed several billions of naira each and supported the CACOVID effort with advocacy. In all, according to him, over 100 organisations and private individuals contributed to CACOVID.
