The Director of new media of the All Progressives Congress presidential campaign council (APC PCC), Mr Femi Fani-Kayode says he regrets raising the alarm over the fear of an impending coup d’ etat in the country. Speaking to reporters yesterday in Abuja after he was grilled by the department of state security services (DSS) for five hours, he admitted that he should have been circumspect before going public on the issue. He added: “Sometimes when in the war front because we are in a war presently on the political front. While experiencing such war there is the fog of war where we say either the right things or the wrong things. Nobody is infallible. But the truth is when it comes to the issue of national security, we have to be careful.” Acknowledging that the coup alarm raised shock waves across the polity, he explained that his action was aimed at drawing the attention of security agencies to be on top of the situation if there was any iota of truth on the matter. The former minister of Aviation remarked that he had to honour the DSS invitation because his hands were clean on the matter adding that he is under instruction by the DSS to report back every Wednesday of the week pending whether he would be charged to court or the matter is laid to rest. Recalling his ordeal in the hands of the DSS, he noted: “I was subjected to a thorough grilling, they were very inquisitive and very professional. I wasn’t oppressed and they were not acting on the call for my arrest by the PDP.” Nevertheless, he challenged the presidential candidate of the PDP, Atiku Abubakar to make himself available for a similar grill in the hands of the DSS over his role in the alleged theft of SPV monies running into billions of naira.
