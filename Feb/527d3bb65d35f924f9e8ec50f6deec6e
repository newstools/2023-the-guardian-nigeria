INSPECTOR General of Police (IGP), Alkali Baba Usman, has deployed four Commissioners of Police in Delta State to secure life and property before, during and after the general elections The commissioners are John Babangida, posted as Election CP, Delta State Command; Mamman Sanda to Delta North; Zachariah Fera to Delta South; and Adebola Hamzat to Delta Central. A statement by the Command’s spokesman, Bright Edafe, yesterday, said the police officers are to work in synergy with other sister agencies, which had deployed their personnel across all polling units, collation centres, and INEC offices to protect the electorate and INEC officials. He said: “Marine Police have equally been deployed to waterways to ensure the area too is peaceful during the election. “There will be restriction of vehicular movement from 0000 hours to 1800 hours on February 25, only officials on emergency and essential duties, which include accredited election monitors and observers, will be allowed passage during this time. “While regretting the inconveniences this will cause, members of the public are advised to adhere to this instruction as anyone found wanting will be made to face the full wrath of the law.” He added: “The ban on VIP escorts during the election still stands. They are, therefore, advised not to move with their security details on election day, and any officer found wanting will be arrested and sanctioned accordingly.” He said the CP Election had advised all non-state actors (vigilante, anti-cult volunteers, hunters and others.) that they would not be playing any role during the elections and should steer clear of polling units and the entire election process, as any of them found meddling in the process would be dealt with.
