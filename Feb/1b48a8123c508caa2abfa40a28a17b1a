Rashford Doubtful For Final
Manchester United manager, Erik ten Hag says Newcastle are an “annoying team to play against” because of their time wasting. His team faces Newcastle in tomorrow’s Carabao Cup final at Wembley. “They do really well. They’re an annoying team to play against, so we have to find a way to win. They try to annoy you. We have to make sure that we play and focus on our game. For instance, referees want to play effective time. They have the lowest in the league and they are quite successful with it. So it’s up to us that we get speed in the game, but also we are then dependent on the refereeing as well.” “We have to make it our game, so focus on the job we have to do, focus on playing football when the ball is in the game. Don’t get distracted from what can be, whatever is on the pitch. We have to focus on the job and find our way and find the moments where we can strike.” Ten Hag went on to add that he did not know whether Marcus Rashford would be fit for yomorrow’s final after coming off injured in Thursday’s 2-1 win over Barcelona as United sealed their place in the last 16 of the Europa League. The England forward was substituted in the 88th minute and later posted on Instagram, an image of himself walking down the touchline looking in discomfort accompanied by a bandaged emoji. Anthony Martial has definitely been ruled out through injury.
