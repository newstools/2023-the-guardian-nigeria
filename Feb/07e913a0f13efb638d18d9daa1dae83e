To tackle emergencies that may arise during the forthcoming elections, the Federal Fire Service, (FFS), has deployed its utility vehicles and personnel to ensure the safety of the public. Controller General, FFS, Abdulganiyu Jaji, said the move is to enable Nigerians to exercise their franchise with ease as an effective and thorough fire safety plan has been put in place for a grand fire coverage through a robust synergy of the fire service, Nigerian Police Force, military and the paramilitary agencies. In a statement signed by the Public Relations Officer, (PRO), of the service, Abraham Paul, Jaji said the FFS has deployed utility vehicles to states Controllers to further facilitate their surveillance during the elections as well as approved hotlines to report cases of fire or related emergencies before, during and after the elections processes to forestall the occurrence of avoidable fire hazards. “Our collective security strategy is to implement the Fire Service mandate for fire prevention which is in tandem with the policies that ensure the smooth and safe conduct of election protocols. “The Federal Fire Service calls on all and sundry to call the phone numbers below in their various states including the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja to report any issue that could compromise the safety of lives and property during this period,” he said. In the foregoing, the CG also warns that members of the public while carrying out their civic duties should desist from using or harbouring inflammable such as petrol, kerosene among others and primary sources of ignition including cigarettes, lighters, matchboxes and other explosive devices at or near any polling unit.
