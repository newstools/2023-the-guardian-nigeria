A magistrateâ€™s Court sitting in Port Harcourt has convicted and sentenced a man identified as Goodluck Okasanya to 21 years in prison for conspiracy, child trafficking, and stealing. Okasanya was convicted for trafficking a-year and nine-month-old baby identified as Kelvin Chima for the sum of N25, 000. The court also convicted and sentenced Chinonye Okpara, who was reported to be the lover of Okasanya to five-years in prison without an option of fine for the same offence as Okasanya. Okasanya was alleged to have deceived Okpara into running away with the little child to Aba, in Abia State, where they sold the baby.
Chief Magistrate Rita Oguguo, who described Okasanya as a hardened criminal, in her judgment said the prosecution counsel proved their case beyond reasonable doubt. However, the 21-year imprisonment sentence of Okasanya is to run consecutively while the five years of Okpara will run concurrently.
