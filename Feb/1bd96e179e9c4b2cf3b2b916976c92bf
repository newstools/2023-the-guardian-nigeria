There was uneasy calm, yesterday, across Delta State as the electorate awaited results of presidential and National Assembly elections held on Saturday. While the people expected Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in the state to have declared the results, the Commission said it was waiting for its field officials in councils. At the state INEC office in Asaba and the senatorial collation centre beside Oshimili Council secretariat, also in Asaba, it was a ding-dong affair, even as residents and electorate waited anxiously. The delay in the release of results has led to accusations attempts to manipulate the process. Traffic on most of the roads, including the usually busy Asaba-Onitsha expressway and Nnebisi road, was light, with some businesses shut. Meanwhile, contrary to the rumour that results of last Saturdayâ€™s presidential and National Assembly election for Ika North-East Local Council of Delta, State had be cancelled, spokesman for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Presidential Campaign Council, Mr. Charles Aniagwu, yesterday, insisted that the report was untrue, urging the general public to disregard it. Ika North-East is the council of origin of the PDP vice presidential candidate and Governor of the state, Ifeanyi Okowa. Aniagwu, who is also the state Commissioner for Information, in a statement in Asaba, said the purported cancellation was the figment of the imaginations of the purveyors of the fake news, explaining that the results for the elections in the area have been duly accepted and declared by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the PDP won in the area.
