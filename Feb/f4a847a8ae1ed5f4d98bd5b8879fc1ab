Electorate have been urged to vote for a candidate that will promote unity and progress of the country in the forthcoming presidential election.
  
The National Coordinator, BAT Ambassadors for Nigeria’s Greatness (BANG), Chief Jamiu Afolabi Ekungba, in a statement made available to The Guardian, said as the presidential election draws closer, it is becoming clearer that the contest is not just one between political parties but between the forces of unity of the country and the forces for its disintegration.
  
He said the February 25, 2023 presidential election is an existential watershed in the annals of Nigeria and it is the civic responsibility of all patriots to see it in this perspective.  Ekungba said if Nigeria’s motto is the foundation of its greatness, Bola Ahmed Tinubu (BAT) is the epitome of its ethos.
 
He defended this by saying that BAT is a detribalised Nigerian who has cultivated deep and mutually beneficial relationships with people in every part of Nigeria adding that this has afforded him the opportunity to understand the peculiar needs of all Nigerians and this will equip him to meet those needs when in power.
