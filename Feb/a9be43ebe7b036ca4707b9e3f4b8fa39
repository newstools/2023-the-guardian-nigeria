Femi Oladehin, a House of Representatives candidate in the 2023 general elections, has charged well-meaning Nigerians to embrace and be part of politics, stressing that the field shouldn’t be left in the hands of corrupt or dirty Nigerians. Oladehin, who is contesting to represent the people of Eti Osa Federal Constituency under the platform of the African Democratic Congress (ADC), said the only way to have credible politicians and leaders was if credible Nigerians participated and ran for office. He stressed that it was imperative that the false narrative that politics was only for morally bankrupt Nigerians changes. The seasoned investment banker, who says he is running to deliver “purposeful representation,” said this during a recent media interview where he shared his agenda for the people of the Eti Osa constituency. According to him, after years of failed promises, Eti Osa deserves a candidate who will focus on the constituency’s needs and attract an increased federal presence. Speaking about his decision to join politics, Oladehin expressed his concerns about the current crop of leaders in the country, saying, “The more candidates who can impact the lives of the people stay away from politics, the worse it becomes with our current crop of leaders. I threw my hat into the mix because I do not want to sit back quietly and let incompetent people ruin the country.”
