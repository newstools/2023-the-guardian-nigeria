The culture of chivalry originated in the medieval period in Europe, arising from the ideals of knighthood and the codes of conduct associated with the combatant class.
The Christian church and tales of legendary knights such as, King Arthur and the Round Table, influenced the notion of chivalry.
Chivalry emphasised virtues such as honour, bravery, loyalty, and courtesy, and knights were expected to exemplify these qualities in their behaviour not just primarily towards women, but other knights, and the weak and vulnerable. However, in modern times, the culture of chivalry has been romanticised and idealised, often portrayed in literature, movies, and popular media as the epitome of medieval knights in shining armor. Yet, the values and principles of chivalry have been adapted and incorporated into various societies and cultures, serving as a model for behaviour and etiquette in various forms, such as in the gentlemanly conduct expected of men in some cultures, or in the respectful treatment of women in others. Some countries still carry out childcare acts to reflect their culture. In China, dragon Boat Racing is a traditional water sport that is practised we’re teams of men row dragon-shaped boats, racing against each other and trying to be the first to reach the finish line. This sport is considered to be a celebration of strength, unity, and teamwork, and is often performed at various cultural events and festivals. Meanwhile in India, Jallikattu is a traditional bull-taming sport that is practised in Tamil Nadu. This way, men demonstrate their strength and courage by trying to hold onto the hump of a bull for a certain period without being thrown off. Again the act is a stamp of strength and bravery and is often performed during the festival of Pongal. In West Africa, the traditional practice of ‘hare’ by the Fulani people is considered a chivalric act. ‘Sharo’ is a traditional wrestling competition where the strength and skill, of a man, are put to test as they compete to find a wife, and, the winner is often considered a hero in his community and is honoured with feasts and celebrations. The act of participating in sharing is seen as a demonstration of manliness, bravery, and physical prowess. Chivalry was important in the medieval period because it provided a code of conduct for the warrior class, who held a significant amount of power and influence in society. The ideals of chivalry served as a way to regulate their behaviour, temper, and aggression on the battlefield, as well as to establish a set of moral standards for their interactions with others. This particularly became important in a time when warfare was a frequent occurrence, and knights were often called upon to engage in battles and raids. As for the misconception that chivalry is only shown to women, this likely stems from the idea that knights were expected to demonstrate special reverence and respect for women, who were often seen as the embodiment of purity and virtue as reflected in the codes of chivalry, which emphasized the protection of women and the weak, as well as the courteous treatment of all individuals, regardless of their status or gender. Thus, chivalry was not limited to women and applied equally to all individuals. In the 21st century, chivalry is often viewed in the original precepts. However, with the rise of feminism and independent women, the traditional notion of chivalry as being exclusively tied to male-female relationships has been challenged. Some view it as outdated and patriarchal, also incompatible with contemporary values of equality and mutual respect. While others see this same chivalry as a way to promote equality and reciprocate actions in all relationships. The definition and understanding of chivalry in the 21st century continue to evolve but at its core. Even though it appears as a historical relic that has no place in society today, it remains a principle of treating others with dignity and respect. However, chivalry is seen as a complex and multifaceted concept, whose meaning and significance are subject to ongoing debate and interpretation.
