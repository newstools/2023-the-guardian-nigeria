A group, Sokoto Network for Good Governance on Sunday passed a vote of confidence on Gov. Aminu Tambuwal’s administration in Sokoto State and expressed support for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidates in the 2023 general elections. Addressing a world press briefing in Sokoto, the Convener General, Mr Faruk Gada, said PDP wielded about 74 per cent support-base among the citizens in the State. Gada said based on an independent survey conducted by the association, PDP was in better position to win all the elective positions in the forthcoming general elections. He said that the network used interviews, questionnaire, media presence and as well as social media viability in conjunction with cluster sampling technique across the 23 Local Government Areas of the state to arrive at the conclusion. Gada added that the network was a collectivity of people of like minds that were concerned on issues of politics and good governance which remained the key toward having development in the state and country at large. ”This was also based on an assessment of all the major political parties that made themselves available for consideration in the forthcoming general election. ”We came to the conclusion that, the only party that is ready to bring the much-needed progress and development in this country,  particularly Sokoto state is PDP. ” The decision was arrived at following a keen consideration of the general posture and postulations of all political parties. “We came to the conclusion that PDP is the only party that is prepared for the daunting task of rebuilding the nation,” Gada said. The Convener General added that network considered the achievements of Tambuwal as a Governor, the Chairman of the Nigerian Governors’ Forum and the Director General of Atiku/Okowa campaign organisation. He called on the people of the State to support the PDP governorship candidate, Sa’idu Umar and his running mate, Sagir Bafarawa for for the continuity of good governance.
