   The two-time Olympic medalist noted that every athlete currently representing or those that represented Lagos State was built by coaches of clubs, hence the need to recognise the coaches and their clubs for their key roles in developing talents through the competition.
 
Giving a breakdown of activities lined up at the series, Udo-Obong said the competition would hold in Lagos on four legs in February, April, May and June.
 
He said there is a cash price of over N10 million for the winners to encourage the athletes to work hard, adding that two clubs from Togo and Benin Republic have indicated interest to participate in the competition.
 
At the event, a technical committee that will oversee the competition was inaugurated. Members of the committee are Mrs. Olapade Lawal, Mr. Tola Adebayo, Mr. Abiodun Ibrahim, Mr. Lakan Soyitan, Mr Olufemi Daramola and Mr. Tunde Suleiman.
