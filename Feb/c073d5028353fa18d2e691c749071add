Kano State governor, Dr. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, has alleged that elements of the annulled June 12, 1993, presidential election are regrouping and dangerously masquerading in the prevailing crisis generated by the naira notes swap policy to scuttle the nation’s hard-earned democracy. He said the group’s latest attempt at that was camouflaging in unknown political parties through the use of legal instruments to further impose the cash policy that is taking its toll on the masses in the country. Reacting to an interim injunction issued by a federal high court in Abuja, stopping the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) from extending the 10-day deadline set for the currency swap, the governor noted that the unknown political parties are also allegedly colluding with the main opposition party, the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) to execute their agenda. In a statement issued by the commissioner for information, Malam Muhammad Garba, the governor further observed that the open support for the policy by the main opposition party and its presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar are complicit with the CBN to deliberately thwart the nation’s hard-earned democracy by imposing harsh policies calculated to weaken the masses. He said it was unfortunate that the CBN and its collaborators are insisting on the time frame for the old naira notes to cease to be legal tender. Ganduje further stated that the rigid insistence on the implementation of ‘these harsh, inhuman, and insensitive cash policies’ to a point of neglecting their widespread rejection by the vast majority of Nigerians including the National Assembly and all state governors. He said it is an agenda to undermine the nation and scuttle a smooth transition to a freely and fairly elected successive administration.
