Member representing Abi/Yakurr Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives, Dr. Alex Egbona, has described Biomodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) as a near-perfect system. Egbona, who said this in an interview with some newsmen, yesterday, in his country home in Ekureku in Abi, noted: “This is a perfect system minus few problems. This system is one system, which everyone can vote.” He, however, said: “BVAS is slow in capturing everybody. In my area, for instance, where we have 1,300 voters, not all voted. INEC should be sincere in the business. You employ officials from the University of Calabar to preside over elections without vehicles and the returning officers arrive their stations late.  Some presiding officers go to a ward with 15 units with just one vehicle, how does he monitor the other units?” He advised the electoral body to devolve some of its responsibilities to political parties by allowing parties to do their tags instead of INEC making tags for parties.
