Osun State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has commended the police for arresting eight armed thugs suspected to be sponsored by the All Progressives Congress (APC) at Thursday’s presidential rally at Osogbo. In a statement, yesterday, Caretaker Chairman of Osun PDP, Dr. Akindele Adekunle, warned against any attempt to free the hoodlums, calling on the Commissioner of Police to parade and charge the suspects to court without delay. He stated: “We learnt from credible sources that the police has arrested eight armed thugs of the APC. We gathered, too, that the thugs have confessed that they belong to APC and were brought to the venue by APC chieftains. “Our intelligence also revealed that since the arrest of the hoodlums, top APC leaders have been mounting pressure on the police to quietly release them. While the police are reportedly planning to arraign the bandits on Monday (today), APC leaders are alleged to be pulling strings to get their agents of deaths off the hook.” According to the PDP, the arrested suspects were in possession of pump action guns, pistols, cutlass, axes and other dangerous weapons.  Osun PDP commended the police for its smart handling of law and order, despite the provocative actions of the APC before, during and after the presidential rally. Adekunle added: “We commend the police for displaying professionalism and impartiality. This case must be pursued to a logical conclusion. All suspects must have their day before the law. The CP must not succumb to pressure from the APC.”
