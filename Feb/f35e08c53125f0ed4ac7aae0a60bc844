During the graduation ceremony on Friday in Maiduguri, the Executive Director of AHI, Adenike Esiet, said the adolescent girls were children of Internally Displaced Persons at the El-Badawi Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) camp in Maiduguri. Esiet said the graduates comprised of 200 trained in local cap (Zanna) making while 100 were trained in computer literacy and coding. Esiet said the 200 girls who graduated in cap making were given start-up package containing materials for five caps to sustain their business, while the 100 computer learners, still in school, would be given certificates. She noted that the research conducted in the camp by AHI on sexual and reproductive health and rights challenges of adolescent girls and young women in the camp, necessitated such support as part of measures to adress the challenges.

Esiet said other measures taken to address the challenges included reaching out to 2,300 adolescent girls and young women with Sexual Reproductive Health (SRH) information and services. “We also engaged husbands and female partners to improve acceptance of SRH services and mitigate Gender Based Violence (GBV) in the camp,” Esiet said. She lauded Borno Government, trainers, parents and leaders in the camp for their support towards the success of AHI programme. In his remarks on behalf of facilitators, Albishir Ibrahim, said those who acquired the ICT training should consider themselves also equipped to face the 20th century challenges. “What you learnt is important and valuable in any sector,” Ibrahim said.
