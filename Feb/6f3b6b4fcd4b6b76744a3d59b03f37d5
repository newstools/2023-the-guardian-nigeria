   If and when you are knocked down, insurance will put you back on your feet!
As you go voting for our next President, this month, let your mind be insured and understand that, like insurance, your vote should bring Nigeria back on her feet; thus our pieces of advice include:  First, start with insuring yourself against the losses or damages that could result from electioneering activities. Personal Accident Insurance, which covers you against accidents 24/7 anywhere within Nigeria is recommended for all at this time.
 
Two, a group you belong today may choose to take Group Personal Accident Insurance and/or Group Life Assurance to make it more accessible and inclusive for members. Some prefer going with the group. Three, knowing that accidents during elections could lead to deaths, disabilities and injuries, which the insurance coverages will relieve you from, ensure you choose the best insurers for these types of insurance.
Ekerete Ola Gam-Ikon. Four, before you vote to have any or both of the insurance coverages recommended, be sure to know the specific unit designated by Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for you to vote. Your insurer may be interested in that information. Five, remember to purchase the insurance for the period of 12 months knowing that accidents and their effects still occur after the elections. Decide today who you will vote and join other Nigerians to ensure an insured and secured future for all of us.
