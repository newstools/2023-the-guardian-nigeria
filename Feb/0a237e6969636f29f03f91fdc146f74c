Edo State Government has concluded a two-week onboarding for new employees into the state’s civil and public service, charging the workers on productivity and efficient service delivery to people. The state’s Head of Service, Anthony Okungbowa, at the closing ceremony of the onboarding programme, said the recruitment of professional and qualified personnel into the service is part of the state government’s efforts to strengthen its workforce, equipping them with the tools and knowledge to enhance productivity and deliver quality services to citizens. He said: “The idea is to populate the public service with personnel with the right skills to effectively deliver on their role of enhancing development in the state. “Capacity building is one of the key instruments of the reforms put in place to restructure the civil service. You must imbibe the culture of diligence and commitment at your various duty posts to deliver on the Making Edo Great Again (MEGA) vision of Governor Godwin Obaseki. “The Government has put the needed measures in place to ensure that the civil service is well positioned to perform optimally, introducing technology, providing a conducive work environment, and also providing the necessary equipment for workers to deliver effectively on their roles.  There is a responsibility that is solemn to ensure that this route the governor is taking us through is sustained.” During the onboarding programme, participants were taken through the rudiments of public service with a focus on the basic principles of civil service rules/practices. Other areas covered included an overview of the Edo State Transformation and Enhancement project, change management, finance management, and technology in civil service, among others.
