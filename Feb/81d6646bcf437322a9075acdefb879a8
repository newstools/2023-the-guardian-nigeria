Ahead of the 2023 general election, the House of Representatives member representing the Garki/Babura Federal Constituency in the State, Hon. Musa Muhammad dumped the ruling APC for the opposition Peoples Democratic Party, (PDP). A letter he addressed to the chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC) Kore ward, Garki Local Government indicated that he is quitting the party due to a series of conflicts and happenings. “I write to notify the party that I resigned my membership of the APC from 21 of February 2023. “This is due to series of conflicts and happenings at all the stages of the party, I am therefore thanking the party for allowing me to contest on its platform,” he wrote. Briefing newsmen at the residence of the PDP gubernatorial candidate after the round off of the party ‘s local government campaign in Birnin Kudu, the lawmaker said his decision came after a wide consultation with constituents on why he was defecting from the APC and join the opposition PDP. Musa said he will join forces with the PDP gubernatorial candidate, Mustapha Sule Lamido, to ensure the victory of the party in the 2023 general elections. “I am here because I want to help a friend, we attended the same university, I am here to help the party win the election,” he said.
The lawmaker was anointed by Governor Muhammad Badaru Abubakar to replace his late father, Muhammad Adamu Fagen-Gawo, who died in Dubai after a brief illness. He won the seat in a by-election with 48,318 votes to defeat PDP candidate, Nasir Garba Dantiye who scored 24,135 votes.
