The General Manager and Chief Executive Officer, National Theatre, Prof. Sunday Enessi Ododo, has donated 15 titles of his books to the library of Crown-Hill University, Ilorin, Kwara State. He made the donation while paying a courtesy call on the new Vice-Chancellor, Crown-Hill University (CHU), Prof. Jeleel Olasunkami Ojuade, at the council chamber of the university. While congratulating the new VC on his appointment, Prof. Ododo said given Prof. Ojuade’s antecedents, he merits the appointment. He prayed for the VC’S success on the job and pledged his availability to provide genuine counsel and mobilise the critical support needed for an outstanding performance. Ododo, a mentor of Ojuade, went down memory lane, when, as Head of Department, Performing Arts, University of Ilorin, in 2001, he was instrumental to the appointment of Jeleel as a Graduate Assistant. He expressed the joy of every good teacher and mentor in seeing their students and mentees succeed and surpass them. He called on the university’s principal officers and expanded management to cooperate and support Ojuade so that his transformation agenda could materialise. In his response, Prof. Ojuade thanked the visitor for paying him a courtesy call on his appointment. He appreciated Ododo for his kind gesture. He promised to keep the flag flying and uphold the better by far pay off, Unilorin is known for.
