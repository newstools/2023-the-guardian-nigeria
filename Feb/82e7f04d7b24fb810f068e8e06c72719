Driving African culture to the peak of global recognition and accurate representation through gaming, Gebeta, a product of Qene Games, has been acquired by Carry1st, Africa’s mobile games and interactive content publisher.  Mancala is culturally deeply rooted across frontier markets and Gebeta’s modern reinterpretation lays the foundation for what we believe will become a marquee mobile game in Africa and around the world. We are grateful for our partnership with Qene Games and the opportunity to continue catalyzing the mobile games industry in Africa.”
