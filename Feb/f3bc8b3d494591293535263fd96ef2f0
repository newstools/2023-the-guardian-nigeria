President of Nigeria Volleyball Federation (NVBF), Musa Nimrod, has commended the decision of International Volleyball Federation (FIVB) to admit three African nations into the world championship. He described it as a great step in the right direction, saying such international tournaments and championships would help develop young African players, to do better and showcase their talents on the world stage. Speaking while reacting to the country’s U-19 women team’s qualification for this year’s FIVB Volleyball Girls’ U-19 World Championship billed for Croatia and Hungary, Nimrod said: “The slot given to Nigeria by FIVB means we can showcase our talents to the world in Croatia and Hungary. The female players can also have the opportunity of being selected by scouts of foreign teams.” The news of Nigeria’s qualification for the world championship was contained in a statement by FIVB’s Volleyball Department Project Manager, Yiting Cao, who advised the country to confirm her participation by completing the attached entry form and return it on or before tomorrow. Cameroun and Egypt placed first and second, respectively, at the 2022 CAVB Volleyball Girls’ U-19 African Championship in Abuja to also book their tickets to the world championship. The 2023 FIVB Volleyball Girls’ U19 World Championship will hold from August 1 to 11 in Croatia and Hungary.
