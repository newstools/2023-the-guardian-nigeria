FGM can also lead to severe medical complications in women such as infertility as infection due to FGM is one of the main causes of Infertility. FGM also increases the risk of HIV transmission and can cause severe complications during childbirth. We must understand that FGM is recognized internationally as a violation of the human rights of girls and women. This practice needs to stop immediately. Empowering girls with the right education is the only solution to this age-norms that also promotes gender inequality.” Dr. Rasha Kelej added.

The singer presented a new song created to support Girl Education during the episode. Fashion designers from Senegal – Safietou Seck and Aicha Fatou Gaye also featured in this episode and showcased their designs that displayed strong and relevant messages about stopping FGM. FGM comprises of a procedure that involves altering or injuring the female genitalia for non-medical reasons and is recognized internationally as a violation of the human rights, the health and the integrity of girls and women. Girls who undergo female genital mutilation face short-term complications such as severe pain, shock, excessive bleeding, infections, and difficulty in passing urine, as well as long-term consequences for their sexual and reproductive health and mental health. Although primarily concentrated in 30 countries in Africa and the Middle East, female genital mutilation is a universal problem and is also practiced in some countries in Asia and Latin America. “I strongly believe that Education is one of the most critical areas of women empowerment and will definitely help in stopping practices such as FGM which do not benefit anyone. Through our “Educating Linda” program, we support young girls who are unprivileged but brilliant to continue their education, from many African countries. The spirit of the project is to provide an opportunity to such girls to pursue their dreams and reach their potential through access to education.  Merck Foundation has released many inspiring children’s storybooks and songs to support girl education”, emphasized Senator Kelej. 1.
