Workers of Enugu State, under the auspices of the Organised Labour, yesterday, expressed gratitude to Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi for his interventions in improving their welfare despite challenges such as nation’s economic recession, lean resources, outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, security issues, among others. The workers expressed delight that Ugwuanyi prioritised their welfare by introducing payment of 13th month salary, as well as implementation of N30, 000 new minimum wage with its consequential adjustment. Stressing that the governor was the first to witness economic recession on two occasions in five years, and faced with challenges of not being in the same political party with government at the national level, the workers noted that Ugwuanyi’s commitment to their welfare first manifested when he paid 54 per cent equity contribution for 100 lucky civil servants, who won 100 units one bedroom apartments at Elim Estate, Enugu, through open lottery.
