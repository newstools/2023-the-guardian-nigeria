â€¢ Warned against plot to prevent polls in seven councils of Imo
HUMAN Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, (HURIWA), yesterday, tasked Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof. Mahmood Yakubu to order immediate arrest and prosecution of INEC staff members involved in dumping of a bag filled with thousands of Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) in a forest in Anambra State. HURIWA, in a statement by its National Coordinator, Emmanuel Onwubiko, demanded swift action by security agencies to investigate the incident and arrest INEC staff and other saboteurs, who did this unthinkable and unspeakable electoral heist of disenfranchising millions of Igbo. Relatedly, HURIWA has asked the Chief of Defence Staff, General Lucky Irabor, to ensure there is election in all councils of Imo State. The rights group has also called on the Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Faruk Yahaya, to deploy sufficient armed troops to Okigwe, Onuimo and Ideato North councils to provide adequate security to life and property during the election. Also, the rights group said a Senior Director in INEC alerted it that there is a plot to prevent election in seven out of the 21 councils of Imo due to attacks by unidentified persons. The group said it would be the greatest crime against humanity should government and heads of military and security institutions look away while armed non-state actors move freely in parts of the state, killing and destroying choice property.
