Residents of some communities in Ibadan, Oyo State, have expressed fear over the appearance of a strange helicopter hovering in their neighbourhood. Communities, where the helicopter is sighted are: Egbeda, Lagelu, Ibadan North, Ibadan North East, and Ona-Ara local councils. According to residents, the helicopter has been hovering overhead the communities in the last few days, raising concerns among residents. They lamented that it hovers close to the roofs of people’s homes, sending a frightening message to the communities. A woman at Laogun area of Egbeda local council said: “We don’t know what is happening. We have been seen this aircraft many times today.  Is anything happening?” Residents called on security agencies to address the concern of the people. However, a source told The Guardian that the Federal Government might be conducting an aerial geo-physical survey in the communities, adding that the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development has released a circular to that effect. The source said: “A circular was released by the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development months back, notifying the general public that the Mineral Sector Support for Economic Diversification (MINDIVER) project, a World Bank-assisted project under the Ministry of Mines and Steel-Development will embark on an Airborne Geophysical Survey Activity in 19 states of the federation, covering 112 local councils to determine accurate mineral location, using modern-day aero-magnetic mechanism”.
