The First Lady, Aisha Buhari, has denied posting a purported Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) statement on her Instagram page for the recirculation of old 500 and 1000 naira notes. Aisha in a statement said the post was published on her social media handles after being hacked on Tuesday. CBN thereafter refuted the claim in the purported statement that it has directed commercial banks to recirculate old 500 and 1000 naira notes.

It is the responsibility of the security agencies to find out who am I sharing my social media handles with, despite being verified accounts, and take all necessary actions.”
