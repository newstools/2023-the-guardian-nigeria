The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Ogun Central senatorial candidate, Chief Olumide Aderinokun, has encouraged residents of the six local councils in his senatorial district to vote for the party’s presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar in the forthcoming general election.
 
Addressing his supporters during his ward-to-ward campaign tour of the senatorial district, Aderinokun said that electing a senator on the same platform as the president comes with a lot of benefits.
  
In Ifo Constituency 1, he told  market leaders, religious leaders and artisans to dismiss the thought of a Yoruba presidency, and vote for a competent, dependable, fit, and experienced leader like Atiku.
 
His words: “With your support, I believe you will elect me as your senator in the 10th National Assembly, but the mission is not complete without voting PDP from top to bottom.
 
“Alhaji Atiku Abubakar is more like a father to me, because I have a personal relationship with him and he promised unrelenting support for us. You are aware that one of his wives is also a Yoruba woman, though this election is not about tribe or religion, but competency. “Atiku is a man of his word and he will deliver in restructuring the country. My work in the upper chamber will be seamless if we have a president from our party, because we will be the majority and I seek your support in making it happen by February 25.”
 
The senatorial hopeful rounded up his visit to Ifo by committing ₦1m to further develop Ifo Central Mosque. Earlier in the week, he supported the construction of an Anglican Church in the Oloto community with ₦500,000.
