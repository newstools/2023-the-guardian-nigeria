Over 40 anti-corruption Civil Society Organisations have protested against the incessant disobedience to court orders by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) under Abdulrasheed Bawa, and the seeming politicisation of the agency’s activities.  “This culture of impunity as consistently exhibited by the EFCC Chairman continues to ridicule Nigeria in the comity of nations and sabotage efforts at attracting foreign direct investment. Investors only go to jurisdictions where the rule of law and respect for human rights are guaranteed while shunning countries where ‘rule of men’ predominate,” they added. 
 
“It is not for EFCC and its leadership to pick and choose which court orders to obey or disregard. That is an invitation to anarchy,” they maintained.
