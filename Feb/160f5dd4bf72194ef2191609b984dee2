The Federal High Court in Lagos has granted an injunction restraining the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) from engaging the Chairman of the Lagos Parks and Garages, Musiliu Akinsanya, popularly known as MC Oluomo or any of his representatives in the distribution of election materials and adhoc staff for the forthcoming polls in the state. Justice Chukwujekwu Aneke granted the injunction following an application filed by the Labour Party and Boot Party in Lagos. INEC was reportedly absent at the proceedings even though a lawyer to the Labour Party told the court that the commission was served with the court papers. The Labour Party and five other plaintiffs had gone to court to seek an interlocutory injunction restraining INEC, “whether by itself or by its officers, affiliates, servants, privies or agents or any person acting or purporting to act for and on behalf howsoever from taking any steps or further steps whatsoever in furtherance of the engagement or appointment or consummating the appointment of Musiliu Akinsanya, popularly known as MC Oluomo led Lagos State Parks Management Committee or any of its commercial bus drivers to distribute 2023 election materials and personnel in Lagos State pending the hearing and determination the substantive suit”. In the ruling, the judge restrained INEC from taking any steps or further steps whatsoever in furtherance of the engagement of the Lagos State Parks Management Committee led by MC Oluomo pending the hearing and determination of the substantive suit.
