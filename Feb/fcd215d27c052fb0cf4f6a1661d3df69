The Catholic Pontiff, Pope Francis, has announced the creation of Catholic Diocese of Aguleri, in Anambra State. 
 
A statement from the Holy See Press Office also disclosed the appointment of Bishop Denis Isizoh as the new diocese’s pioneer bishop. The new diocese was carved out from the Catholic Archdiocese of Onitsha, where Valerian Okeke is the Archbishop. 
 
Recall that Aguleri is the birthplace of Nigeria’s most respected and pious priest, Blessed Iwene Tansi.
