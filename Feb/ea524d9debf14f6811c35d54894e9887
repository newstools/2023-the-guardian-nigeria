Villarreal’s Francis Coquelin will miss the rest of the season with a knee injury, the Spanish club said Monday. The French midfielder went off injured in the club’s 1-0 defeat by Barcelona on Sunday in La Liga, after a collision with Franck Kessie. “Coquelin suffered a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee,” said Villarreal in a statement. “(He) will undergo surgery in the coming days and will unfortunately miss the remainder of the current season.” Villarreal are eighth in La Liga and have qualified for the last 16 of the Europa Conference League. Former Arsenal midfielder Coquelin, 31, had made 25 appearances for Villarreal across all competitions, after missing three months last season with an Achilles tendon injury.
