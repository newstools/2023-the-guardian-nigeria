The Lagos State Police Command has declared wanted one President of the supreme body of Ogboni Association Worldwide (Oba Ogboni Agbaye), Tajudeen Olanrewaju Bakare, who was caught on video wielding gun in a broad daylight. Following the emergence of a video earlier this week showing him wielding a pump action rifle and threatening public peace, the Rapid Response Squad (RRS), working on actionable intelligence, carried out a sting operation on the residence of the man in the Surulere area of the state. Found in the suspect’s residence were three pump action rifles, one Beretta pistol magazine, one expended 9mm ammunition, one expended and three live cartridges and a picture frame of the suspect. According to the Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Benjamin Hundeyin, the suspect narrowly escaped arrest. “We have hereby declared him wanted. Any useful information leading to his arrest would be highly appreciated and treated with utmost confidentiality. While appreciating Lagosians for their vigilance and prompt information to security agencies, the Lagos State Police Command warned all trouble makers to steer clear of the state as anyone found wanting would be dealt with in accordance with the law.
