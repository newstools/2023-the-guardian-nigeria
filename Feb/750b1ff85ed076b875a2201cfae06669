Rivers State Government said Governor Nyesom Wike has no hand in the arrest of members of the campaign team of Atiku Abubakar, the presidential candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). About 30 members of the Atiku campaign organisation were reportedly arrested by armed policemen during a meeting in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital. Spokesman of the campaign organisation, Victor Moses, some of those arrested were state and local government leaders of the Atiku campaign team. He alleged that the police operatives may have acted on the instructions of Governor Wike, who has refused to participate in activities of the PDP Presidential Campaign. But Rivers State Commissioner for Information in Rivers State, Chris Finebone, said it is illogical to link the arrest of the PDP members to the state governor. He, however, said the police and other security agencies are free to arrest anyone or group they consider breached the law. The commissioner, who did not confirm if the reported arrest, said the allegation against Wike was part of playing opposition to a government in power. Rivers State police on Monday confirmed the arrest of 32 people. Police spokesperson Grace Iringe-Koko in a statement said the arrest was on a criminal issue and not politically motivated. “The Rivers State Police Command on 5th February 2023 at about 1.30 pm arrested Thirty-two (32) persons from two hideouts in connection with suspected cult-related activities,” Iringe-Koko said. Iringe-Koko said the police in the state have been carrying out targeted raids of criminal hideouts because of the incidents of cult clashes that have been recorded lately. The PPRO also clarified that the arrest was not related to any political meeting, adding that those arrested were being profiled, with seven of them having already been released. She added that all others found to be clean will be released soonest while those found guilty will be charged in court.
