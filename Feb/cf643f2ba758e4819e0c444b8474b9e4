As the world marks the Feast of St. Valentine through expression and assurances of love, today, Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Oyo, Emmanuel Badejo, yesterday, called on Nigerians to make the celebration count by ensuring that the love they express is godly and indelible. For the cleric, if people could actually emulate St. Valentine’s authentic and altruistic love, then the celebration should not only be marked on February 14 alone, but people should live in love always for the society to be a better place to live. The bishop’s Valentine reads: “Once again, it’s Valentine celebration, the feast of love, the feast of lovers. Valentine’s Day is a day for all of us; it’s for everybody. For family, for husbands and wives, for young lovers, for old lovers, for every human being that is made in the image and likeness of God. “St. Valentine, with whom this feast is associated, lived for selfless love that heals and helps other people. Authentic love like his is so much needed in our world today where there is so much hatred, killing, bloodshed and conflicts. We need authentic love and agents of authentic love.”
