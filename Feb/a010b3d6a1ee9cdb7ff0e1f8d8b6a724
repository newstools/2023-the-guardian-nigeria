The Association of Telecommunications Companies of Nigeria (ATCON) is set to host its yearly general meeting (AGM) and elections that would usher in a new set of National Executive Council that would be charged with the responsibility of piloting the affairs of the Association starting from April 2023. ATCON, in a statement, said the importance of the Association in the Nigerian telecommunications sector has increased following the many challenges that the sector is constantly faced with. The body said it is pleased to officially announce to all the Chief Executive Officers and directors of all our qualified member companies to take active part in the AGM and election into the National Executive Council (NEC) of the Association, which is slated to take place on April 4, 2023 in Lagos. 14 posts, including that of the national president; 1st vice president; 2nd VP; national secretary; treasurer coordinator, Internet services providers; coordinator, consulting, among others will be filled. To be eligible, ATCON said any financial member, upon nomination by two other financial members of the Association, shall be eligible for election into any of the elective positions for a term of two years in the first instance subject to re-election for a maximum of two at the AGM where the election is held. “To be qualified for an election, a candidate must be a CEO or at least a Director duly authorized or designated to represent his/her company by its management,” the body stated.
