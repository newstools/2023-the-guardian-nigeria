Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, Prof. Isa Pantami, has urged leaders at all levels to prioritise efforts aimed at providing employment opportunities to citizens, especially youths. Pantami said despite efforts made by current and past governments, as well as leaders across Africa and Nigeria, the level of unemployment is still worrisome, and needs to be addressed for the good of citizens. The minister made the call in Owerri, yesterday, at the graduation ceremony of 5,000 Imo youths trained by the state government, led by Hope Uzodimma, on digital economy, among other technology skills. He stressed that prosperous states and nations today leverage on digital innovations and entrepreneurship, rather than natural resources. While commending Uzodimma for the initiative, Pantami urged the graduands to utilise the skills acquired to add value to their immediate communities, state and the society at large. In his remark, Uzodimma said the programme is part of his determination to ensure that Imo citizens are provided with skills and conducive environment to succeed and excel in life.
