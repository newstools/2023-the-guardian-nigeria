The presidential candidate of the New Nigeria Peoples’ Party (NNPP), Sen. Rabiu Kwankwaso has said he is not in talks with the Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP and former Vice President Atiku Abubakar. Kwankwaso’s reaction is a sequel to claims by the PDP presidential candidate that he was in talks with the former Kano governor and Peter Obi of the Labour Party ahead of the February 25 poll. Atiku in an interview with the BBC Hausa disclosed that talks were ongoing between him and the LP and NNPP candidates. But speaking on Sunrise Daily, a Channels Television breakfast programme monitored by The Guardian on Thursday, Kwankwaso insisted that he won’t step down for anyone. He said: “You see, I was highly disappointed with him because I saw his interview even though it was not as bad as his supporters carried it. He didn’t say me or Peter Obi will step down for him. “What he said from the video that I saw was that he is talking to us and that’s not correct.  Except for here in Lagos when I came to do the arise debate or town hall meeting, since I left PDP have not seen Atiku eye to eye and I refused to talk to anybody. “Because you see, the only thing remaining for PDP and All Progressives Congress, APC, now is propaganda.
