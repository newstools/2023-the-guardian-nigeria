President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration has a duty to apologise to Nigerians for the failure in implementing the redesign policy of the naira and swapping old currencies with the new N200, N500 and N1000 notes. The government has an even more sacred duty to apologise for the unprecedented, horrendous hardship it has needlessly brought on the citizenry. And the government must accept full blame for standing governance on its head and spearheading deep conflict within the federation, as manifested in the dissonance in the president’s directive to Nigerians to spend only the new notes (notwithstanding their unavailability) except the old N200; vis-à-vis the directives of many state governors asking their citizens to spend and accept both old and new notes, in accordance with the order of the Supreme Court delivered on February 8 and reiterated on February 15, 2023. The ensuing confusion has left no citizen in any doubt of President Buhari’s lack of grip on effective governance. In the tardiness of his government, even the simplest of policies tend to turn sour and distasteful because of horrendous execution. The current monetary policy failure is the latest indication of Buhari’s refusal to learn from past errors. While currency redesigning may be well-intentioned, especially against vote-buying ahead of the general elections, handlers miscalculated the overarching effect on the masses and ran afoul of the common good of the country.
