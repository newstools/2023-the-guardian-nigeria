Nobel laureate, Prof. Wole Soyinka, has dismissed as fake, some quotes being attributed to him on social media. According to a statement by his spokesman, Jahman Anikulapo, “Prof. Soyinka did not, at any time or on any occasion, issue such. It is simply the works of peddlers of fake news and falsehood, who profit from misinformation to gain political advantages. “The media and members of the public are advised to ignore the message or any other political message that addresses or targets any political party or political actor.” The quotes are: “Quote me anywhere, Nigerians don’t need the likes of Atiku and Obasanjo to lead them again. We have tasted the two: Atiku is corrupt and Obasanjo is a liar. Both of them are greedy and self-centered…” “Anybody, any cabal, any Viju milk activist, attempting to humiliate Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu must have me to contend with. An average PDP man is angry with Asiwaju because he brought them to their knees. If anyone thinks that bringing down Asiwaju is his project, that mission will not only crash but it will boomerang. He owns Lagos! I hear you! Ask your grandfather and parents how they acquired your so-called family land. Is it God that allocated it to them?”
