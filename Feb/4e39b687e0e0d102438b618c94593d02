Presidential candidate of Social Democratic Party (SDP), Prince Adewole Adebayo, has said Nigeria is off the path of founding fathers. He spoke when he paid homage to the Emir of Lafia, Sidi Bage-Mohammed 1, yesterday, in the Nasarawa State capital. According to him, God did not make mistake in creating Nigeria, rather bad leadership has made it look otherwise. His words: “Nigeria is blessed with so much resources such that every citizen should live above poverty line, but today, 99 per cent (of the population) cannot boast of N100,000 in their savings accounts. “The wealth of this nation is concentrated in the hands of just one per cent, who are stinkingly rich. This is not acceptable. When we are elected, this evil will be corrected. “The people’s welfare was central in the minds of people like Ahmadu Bello, Tafawa Balewa and Obafemi Awolowo. “SDP will unite Nigeria again if elected. Today, we are more divided on ethnic and religious grounds. This was what we never saw happening among our founding fathers till recently.” Responding, the monarch commended the entourage for the visit. He appealed to them to remain peaceful before, during and after the elections.
