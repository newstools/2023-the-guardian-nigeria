Ogun State Commissioner of Police (CP), Frank Mba, has commended Ogun residents for their resilience and peaceful conduct in the face of challenges, resulting from the new Naira policy and paucity of fuel supply in the state. The CP made the commendation during a confidence-building patrol conducted by the police and other security forces in the Gateway State, at the weekend, to assure residents of the command’s resolve to protect life and property, as well as prevent breakdown of law and order. Ogun police spokesman, Abimbola Oyeyemi, said: “The CP further noted that intelligence at the disposal of the command indicates that some criminal elements are planning to take advantage of the challenging economic situation to disrupt the peace in the state. “He, therefore, warned that the police would not fold its arms and allow persons with criminal intentions to hide under any guise, whatsoever, to unleash mayhem on residents, private and public property, and critical national infrastructure, including banks and offices of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).”
 
The CP reportedly assured that necessary security architecture has been emplaced to protect the peace-loving people of Ogun, adding that the Area Commanders (ACs) and Divisional Police Officers (DPOs) had been directed to arrest, and bring to book, any person or group wanting to foment trouble and cause breach of peace in the state.
“To this end, the CP, while empathising with residents, enjoined all parents and guardians, civil society organisations, political and religious leaders, among other critical stakeholders, to prevail on their children, wards and followers, not to resort to violence, as all necessary actions are being taken to further ease the pains of the people in this regard.”
