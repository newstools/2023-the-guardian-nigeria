Egg-free churros are a variation of the traditional Spanish treat that is made without the use of eggs. They are enjoyed by people who either have egg allergies or follow an egg-free diet for personal or religious reasons. Egg-free churros can be found in many Spanish restaurants, as well as in some specialty dessert shops and cafes that offer vegan or egg-free options. They are typically served hot, either on their own or with a dipping sauce such as chocolate or caramel. Some restaurants may also offer additional toppings such as cinnamon sugar or sprinkles.

Instruction
1. Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot over medium-high heat to 180 °C. 2. In a medium bowl, sieve together flour and baking powder. Set aside. 3. In a medium saucepan, add water, sugar, butter, and salt. Bring the water to a boil. 4. Remove from the heat and stir in vanilla extract, flour, and baking powder. Mix well until the dough forms a smooth ball. 5. Let the dough cool down for about 10 minutes before transferring it to a piping bag fitted with a star nozzle. 6. Pipe 12–15 cm lengths of dough onto a tray, snipping the ends with scissors (you can also pipe straight into the hot oil). 7. Fry 5 per batch until crisp and golden brown. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels to drain. 8. Roll the churros in the cinnamon-sugar mixture while still warm. 9. For the chocolate sauce, place everything into a heatproof bowl and melt over a pan with simmering water. Stir well until smooth.
