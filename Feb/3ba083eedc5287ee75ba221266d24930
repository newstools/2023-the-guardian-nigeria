Thugs on Saturday stormed some polling units in Delta and Katsina states and made away with the eight Biomodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) machines, thereby disrupting the elections in that locations. INEC chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu disclosed this at an ongoing media briefing holding at the national collation centre, Abuja. Yakubu said while two BVAS machines were snatched in Oshimili Local Government Area of Delta State, six machines were carted away in Safana Local Government in Katsina state. He, however, said the commission has recovered and voting has commenced in the affected locations. He stated: “Similarly, in Oshimili Local Government Area of Delta State, thugs attacked a polling units and two BVAS machines were lost in the process, but again, because we are determined that election must continue we were able to replace the stolen machines and voting continued in that location. “Similarly, in Safana local government area of Katsina state, thugs attacked one of the voting locations and snatched six BVAS machines but again, we’re able to recover and use the spare machines and reinforced security in that locations and voting continues in that location. “Happily, the security agencies have recovered three of the previous machines but three are still held by the thugs. In these locations, the target of attack was actually the BVAS machines, no longer ballot papers, or ballot boxes, it is the BVAS machines but in the two instances were able to recover and continue with the process.”
