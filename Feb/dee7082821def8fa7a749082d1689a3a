At least three persons were reported killed on Sunday night in a remote community of Maiyanga in Mandar, Bokkos local council of Plateau State. Two other persons, who survived the shooting have been taken to a nearby hospital for treatment. A source from Bokkos told The Guardian yesterday, that around 7: 30. p.m. on Sunday, some Fulani teenagers allegedly came into the community and started shooting. The source said: “Five persons were shot, three died instantly, leaving two injured. Security personnel have not come to the area because the area is very remote. Among the three people shot is a retired police officer. Nothing actually informed the reckless action of the teenage boys. Nobody expected the attacks as people were just hanging around, exchanging pleasantries, but were suddenly taken aback by the sudden emergence of the Fulani youth, armed with AK–47 rifles.” The Spokesperson of the Plateau State Police Command, DSP Alfred Alabo is yet to react but the Military’s Media Officer of the Operation Safe Haven (OPSH) in Jos, Captain Oya James, confirmed the incident. He said the assailants forcefully entered a beer parlour and started shooting the people. Captain James added that before the soldiers of OPSH could get to the scene, the attackers had fled. He said that the military are on their trail to get the hoodlums arrested and prosecuted.
