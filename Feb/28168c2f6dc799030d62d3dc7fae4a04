The Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, (HURIWA) yesterday, asked the Department of State Services and other security agencies to probe alleged plot to unleash mayhem on Igbo resident in Lagos if the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress loses the February 25 poll. In a statement by its National Coordinator, Comrade Emmanuel Onwubiko, he alleged that operatives of the Oodua People’s Congress (OPC) have been directed to store up guns and other dangerous weapons ahead of this month’s presidential poll. The attacks are reportedly planned in areas like Oshodi – Isolo (Mafoluku area to Oke Afa), Ijora Badia ( Amukoko, Alaba Suru, Orile and environs, Ikate, Itire, Ijesha, Cele, Okota, Ajegunle, Olodi Apapa, Coconut, Ojokoro – Ijaye, Agbara, Ojo and Okoko, Satellite town, Festac and Mushin. Onwubiko said: “Security agencies like the Department of State Services and other intelligence agencies must rise up quickly and investigate the reported planned attack on Igbos in Lagos if APC flag bearer loses. Security agencies must swiftly probe this with a view to nipping it in the bud because it has the potential of reigniting a tribal war.”
