Suspected members of Iceland cult have abducted and sexually assaulted a mother of two children, Mrs. Chigbewejim Steward, leading to her death.
     
The woman died a few hours after she was abducted in her community, Abarikpo, Ahoada East Local Council of Rivers State in the wee hours of Sunday, February 12,2023.
    
The Guardian learnt that she was abducted at about 1:00a.m. and later found dead at about 10:00a.m. in the morning in her community Abarikpo, with multiple injuries and blood in her private part.
   
The husband, Lawyer Steward, an Assistant Pastor in Seventh Day Adventist, Abarikpo, told newsmen that the deceased gave birth to three children, but one was late.
   
He said: “The surviving ones, a female and a male are aged seven and three respectively.
 
“I am telling the government that those who murdered my wife should be brought to justice, though one Sunday, a cultist claimed he killed my wife because people told him that my wife always talked against him, that he is a cultist  and that is the reason he murdered her.”
  
Mr. Steward also told newsmen that policemen from Ahoada Police Division in Ahoada Council led by the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) visited the scene on Sunday evening.
