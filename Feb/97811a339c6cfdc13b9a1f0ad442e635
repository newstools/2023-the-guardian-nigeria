Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP) has pleaded with President Muhammadu Buhari to intensify efforts in halting the killings and abductions in the South East. It also charged the Nigerian leader to adopt a political solution to the Nnamdi Kanu issue for genuine reconciliation and peace building in the country. Spokesman for CUPP, Ikenga Ugochinyere, at a press conference, yesterday, in Abuja, also sought immediate arrest and prosecution of people behind the attack on his house in Imo State last month. He regretted that the perpetrators have not been brought to book since January 14. “We hope that the NSA (National Security Adviser) and Mr. President, in keeping to their promise, should order arrest and prosecution of these vultures that have taken over Imo and stop the bloodbath,” he appealed. Ugochinyere advised that the coming elections should be protected to ensure “we all guard our polling units. Ensure nobody takes away the BVAS, especially between the hours of 11a.m. and 4 pm.” He added: Let protect all electoral staff and ensure nobody carries them away. The results must be a reflection of the will of the people. We have heard how they intend to attack polling units to take away BVAS and use accredited figures to write and upload fake results.”
