Former Deputy Inspector-General of Police (DIG) in charge of Operations, Philemon Leha and ex-Permanent Secretary, Kennedy Dauda, have refuted allegation by Dingle Ubeoh community in Adamawa State that they were behind the bloody assault on the settlement. Their counsel, Ehimikhuai Godwin, who issued a 14-day ultimatum to spokesman of the community to withdraw the claim, yesterday, in Yola, exonerated his clients of any wrongdoing. “The allegation levelled against the two gentlemen is totally false, unfounded, spurious and cannot be substantiated with any credible evidence,” he stated. Spokesperson for the community, Hebron Chindo, said: “We want to make it categorically clear that it is no longer secret that a former permanent secretary in the ministry of local government and chieftaincy affairs in Adamawa State, supported by his retired brother DIG are the conflict entrepreneurs behind the raging conflict. “From our investigations, we have sufficient evidence by rampaging youths.” The community, therefore, appealed to Governor Ahmadu Fintiri to intervene. “We appeal to the governor to use his office and end this carnage so that we will continue to live in peace and harmony,” he added.
