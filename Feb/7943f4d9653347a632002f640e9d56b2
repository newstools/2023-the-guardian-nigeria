In a bid to improve technology in the country, a social enterprise, Teens can code in collaboration with Lagos State Science Research and Innovation Council (LASRIC) has unveiled the STEM 360 program with a focus on skills development for secondary school students living in underserved communities of Lagos by expanding access to computer science education and coding opportunities that produce digital transformation literacy. The initiative is committed to spurring innovation in education, developing the next generation of technology and integrating Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Mathematics, Entrepreneurship, and Design Thinking systems into the educational curriculum while supporting the needs of educators and students, bridging the technology talent gap
Founder, of Teens Can Code, Damian Isaac said with the advent of technology, every child has a right to access digital skills to help sharpen the student’s knowledge of technology “We are excited to launch this innovative program in schools across Lagos State, our goal is to provide students with an engaging and interactive learning experience that will help them develop digital skills. “So it’s important that they learn about coding because it has to do with today’s world, it has to do with their future, and of course, coding is taking over, technology is taking over we’ve got into a bound the door is opening, there is technology everywhere, everything around us is technology so young people must learn about this digital economy that we are into,” he said He further revealed that the training will commence on February 8, every Wednesday from one pm to two pm during the students’ extra-curricular activities, training them on global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to understand how to identify problems The program also includes a comprehensive curriculum that is tailored to each student’s individual needs and interests with a focus on problem-solving and critical thinking helping students develop the skills necessary to succeed in a variety of STEM-related fields. Team Lead, STEM 360, Godwin Egba described the initiative as access to digital skills, education, and opportunities for people in underserved communities He further said the initiative will change the narrative in the educational sector by providing the students with training on better use of the computer and how to be technologically inclined. He further urged the teachers to encourage the students to take the course seriously channelling their minds toward technology “The initiative is designed to foster an environment of inquiry and exploration, where students can learn about the world around them and develop the skills necessary to succeed in STEM-related fields. Through a series of interactive activities and projects, students will be able to explore the concepts of engineering, robotics, coding, physics, and more. Tutor General/ Permanent Secretary, Education, District 1, Bashir Adebowale represented by Director, Admin unit, District 1, Iyabo Bello commended the organisers for the Initiative noting that students in district 1 are pacesetters. She further charged the teacher to tailor their strength toward encouraging the students to take the training very seriously and be good ambassadors of the district, urging the students to be stimulated by all they learn at the training.
