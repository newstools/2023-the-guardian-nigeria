The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Lagos State has accused a Labour Party chieftain, Prof Pat Utomi, of invading its office. INEC Resident Electoral Officer (REC) in Lagos State, Olusegun Agbaje told Channels Television that Utomi invaded its office in the Oshodi/Isolo Local Government Area to allegedly hold a press conference inside its conference room. “Today in Lagos, Pat Utomi did what we did not expect a senior Nigerian to do. He virtually invaded our office at Oshodi-Isolo Local Government Area with some people we didn’t know and they held an “illegal” press conference inside our conference room at Oshodi,” Agbaje said.

We informed the police accordingly and the DSS about this invasion. It is uncalled for, it is an act of intolerance on his part, what he did today would have led to violence.” The Labour Party and its chieftain Utomi were yet to respond to the INEC official’s claim at the time of filing this report. Agbaje explained that the issue is that a lot of people that migrated from the South-East want to vote in Lagos but didn’t transfer their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs). He stated that people with double registrations cannot be issued a second PVC because it is assumed that they already have one. Agbaje disclosed that a total of 5,734,559 have been distributed from the old PVCs registered in 2011, 2015 and 2019 while 835,732 PVCs are uncollected. The INEC official noted that the state has received a total of 1.6 million out of which 899,026 have been collected so far and 168,000 uncollected. Overall, Agbaje said the state received a total of 6.6 million PVCs have been collected from 7.6 million with about one million PVCs left, amounting to 87% of collected PVCs so far in the state.
