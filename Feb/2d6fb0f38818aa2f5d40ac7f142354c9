AKA was one of the few famous people who actively opposed xenophobic attacks in the nation. It reads, “We want him to be buried in a secluded venue with leaders and heroes of the society and provide him with security support. We felt a person of this international stature there must be some form of honour.” In a press conference, he claimed that the permission was granted so that the rapper may be honoured during his funeral. He requested that the state flags be flown at half-staff and that the country’s flag be draped over AKA’s casket. Yet their request was rejected for unknown reasons. After a public memorial service on Friday, February 17, 2023, AKA’s funeral will be held the following day, February 18, 2023. AKA’s funeral would be live streamed on his social media channels one week following his murder.
