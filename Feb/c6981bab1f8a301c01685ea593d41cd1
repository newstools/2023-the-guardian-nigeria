Scores of protesters, who identified themselves as concerned Nigerians yesterday, took to major roads in Ibadan metropolis, Oyo State to express anger over the scarcity of fuel and new naira notes. The protest, which took off at the Main Gate of the University of Ibadan (UI), spread to other areas in Ibadan. Soldiers and police officers were deployed to the UI Main Gate to forestall a breakdown of law and order and to direct traffic. The security agents on ground also ordered transporters to remove leaves from their vehicles and Okada. The security operatives were also seen at different points on major routes in Ibadan metropolis. The leader of the protesters, Solomon Emiola said Nigerians have been subjected to hardship, as they were unable to go about daily activities, hence the protest. Emiola said: “We are here as Nigerians to kick against the oppression from the President and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) governor. For some weeks now, Nigerians have been crying and unable to access their hard earned resources. I am a victim. I have my money in the bank but I cannot collect my money, I am hungry and I cannot eat. There is difficulty in using USSD code for transactions. With the scarcity we cannot afford to buy fuel at N350 to N400 per litre.” One of the protesters said he began trekking from Apete to UI on an empty stomach and he was unable to provide for his household.
