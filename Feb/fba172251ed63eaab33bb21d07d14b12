The Collation Officer for the presidential election in Nnewi South Council of Anambra State, Chinwe Isibor, has alleged threat to her life for reportedly refusing to compromise. Isibor, who is an Associate Professor, had claimed that one of the Electoral Officers (EOs) from the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) was behind the plot.

Her alarm forced the Presidential Returning Officer, Prof. Nnenna Otti, who is the Vice Chancellor of Federal University of Technology (FUTO), Owerri, to suspend proceedings. The Resident Electoral Commissioner, Queen Elizabeth Agwu, had to intervene by summoning Isibor to her office for further clarification. She had a private chat with REC under tight security, the content, which was not made public. However, it was gathered that the collation officer refused to compromise during the election, which made her a security risk. It was further learnt that the EO and others wanted her to inflate figures of one of the candidates, to, which she refused.
