Nigerian Professional Football League (NPFL) followers expect the game between Enyimba and Shooting Stars of Ibadan in Aba to be as exciting as their pedigree suggests. Enyimba are serial winners of the NPFL, while Shooting Stars, who were the first Nigerian team to win a continental laurel, have been on the rise since returning to the elite class of the country’s game. Both teams are within touching distance of Group A leaders, Bendel Insurance, and, therefore, will go for the victory that will take them closer to qualification for the championship playoff later in the year. Group A’s midweek games continue in Benin City, where struggling Nasarawa United will try to do the almost impossible, beat Bendel Insurance at the Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium. Insurance have not lost any game out of their six games to keep a stranglehold on top of the table, and so, it will be a tough ask to expect Nasarawa United to beat them in Benin. But this is football in which anything can happen. In other Group A games, Akwa United will host Gombe United at the Godswill Akpabio International Stadium, while El Kanemi Warriors will travel to Plateau United. In Group B, Rivers United will host another struggling giant, Enugu Rangers, at the Adokiye Amiesimaka Stadium, Port Harcourt, while Bayelsa United are away to Niger Tornadoes at the Bako Kontagora Stadium, Minna. Other Group B matches are Dakkada FC versus Sunshine Stars of Akure in Uyo, Wikki Tourists against Lobi Stars of Markurdi, Doma United will welcome Abia Warriors at the Pantami Stadium, Gombe.
