The Co-founder, technology solution company, Payslice, Kelechi Oleka, has said that his organisation has sent loan sharks out of business by being consumer-centric.     Oleka said: “One of the things we realised during the COVID-19 era was that a lot of loan sharks were out there embarrassing people for taking little loans. “We found that what was missing was the need for small funds by people to take care of their immediate needs before their salaries, or paychecks come in. We are glad that the advent of Payslice has effectively sent loan sharks out of business.” On Payslice’s plans for the coming years, Oleka said: “We have started a conversation with top companies and multinationals and our focus is on frontline workers, like Uber, doctors, nurses, security outfits drivers, cleaners, site workers, among others who need cash flow on a day-to-day basis “We have an insurance system, so transactions on the platform are secured. Both employers and employees are assured that their funds are safe. “The last year was good and we are looking at getting more clients to enroll in the system. We estimate that in the next three years, we would have reached one million employees, with each employee having access to their earned salary twice before the end of the month.” Providing updates on the company’s activities for last year, he disclosed that its platform grossed over $1m in transactions in the provision of cash flow for employers and employees in 2022.
