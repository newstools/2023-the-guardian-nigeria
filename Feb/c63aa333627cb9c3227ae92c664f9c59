The governorship candidate of Labour Party (LP) in Plateau State, Dr. Patrick Dakum, has promised that if elected, he would spend his first 100 days in office finding a permanent solution to insecurity. Dakum said he would achieve this by ensuring social justice, irrespective of tribe, ethnicity or religion. He made this known, yesterday, at the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) Press Centre in Jos, where he addressed reporters during a session organised by the NUJ chapel chairman, Gyang Bere. Dakum, a professional public health physician for 40 years, has been a member of the Governing Council of the University of Jos and Commissioner for Information during the administration of Governor Joshua Dariye. The governorship candidate said he plans to provide a strong leadership team that would take bold decisions in favour of people of the state. He denied insinuations that he would soon abandon his governorship ambition and join the All Progressives Congress (APC), just as the Young People’s Party (YPP) candidate did recently. Dakum said he would never disparage Governor Simon Lalong because he holds him in high esteem. He categorically said he would not probe the Lalong administration because “to probe this government is a waste of time. Four years is a very short time. Looking back will be a waste of time.”
