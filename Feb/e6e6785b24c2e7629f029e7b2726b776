• Suspends Esan, Igueben Federal Constituency In Edo The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has postponed elections in 141 polling units in Yenagoa, the Bayelsa State capital, due to violence. The commission also suspended the election in the Esan, Igueben Federal Constituency in Edo State. INEC Chairman, Mahmood Yakubu, who stated these at the second media briefing in Abuja, said the postponement affected the Presidential and National Assembly elections in the area and the elections will be held today (Sunday). In Yenagoa, Yakubu said the process was disrupted in Wards 4, 6, 8, and 14 and the security operatives overcame the challenges. According to him, INEC ad-hoc staff expressed apprehension about going back to conduct the elections, thus necessitating the postponement.
“We have decided that the election will be held on Sunday (today), where 40 out of 141 polling units materials are intact.” On the Esan North, Esan South and Igueben, he said the suspension was due to the omission of the logo of a party on ballot papers. Yakubu disclosed that the poll in the Federal Constituency would now hold on March 11, alongside the governorship and state assemblies’ polls. He said: “In Edo State, we had a situation that we handled yesterday (Friday). One of the parties has its acronym on the score sheet but the logo is not on the ballot paper in a Federal Constituency. “After meeting with the stakeholders, a decision was taken since the materials are intact. So, we have suspended the election for Esan North, Esan South and Igueben.
“The ballot papers will be reprinted and elections will now hold with the constituency elections in the next two weeks.” Yakubu assured Nigerians that INEC was determined to ensure that no Nigerian is disenfranchised.
