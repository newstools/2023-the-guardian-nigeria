Despite post-election uncertainties, investors, yesterday, renewed stakes in stocks with impressive earnings and dividend payout ahead of the 2022 full year scorecards, as market capitalisation of the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) hits N30 trillion.

Also, market capitalisation rose by 379.21 or 0.7 per cent from 54,949.21 points to 55,328.42 points. The upturn was impacted by gains recorded in medium and large capitalised stocks, amongst which are; Geregu Power, Conoil, BUA Foods, Stanbic IBTC Holdings and MRS Oil Nigeria. Analysts at United Capital Plc said: “We expect the equities market to remain bullish despite post-election uncertainties. We foresee opportunities for the buy-side to increase holdings (in the near-term) on fundamentally sound stocks with improved valuation and dividend performance. Nonetheless, we still expect profit-booking activity for overbought stocks.” Market breadth closed positive as 28 stocks posted gains while nine stocks declined.
