The Federal Operations Unit (FOU) Zone A of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), has intercepted over 2,135 wraps, (1,163 kg) of Indian Hemp, 68 pieces of military camouflage and 450 x 106 kilogramme drums of carbide among other seizures worth N517.9 million along Southwest border corridors in January 2023. Displaying the seized items to journalists yesterday, in Lagos, the acting Controller of the Unit, Hussein Ejibunu, said considering the spate of insecurity across the country and the upcoming general elections, the importation of Indian hemp and military camouflage could be used to fuel crimes and electoral violence by unpatriotic elements. He said while the former is under prohibition, the latter are under the control and supervision of the Office of the National Security Adviser, which requires End- User Certificates. Ejibunu said other seized items are 47,750 litres of premium motor spirit (PMS) and over nine trailer load of foreign parboiled rice, 314 pieces of used tyres, 11 units of used motorcycles and 13 units of used vehicles. According to him, the seizures contravene different Customs laws, as 11 suspects were arrested in connection with some of the wares, while the Federal High Court had convicted three. Ejibunu, while handing over the hard drugs to the National Drug Law and Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) urged members of the public to key into the prevailing security concerns by providing useful and timely information that would expose and lead to the arrest of the enemies of the state. The controller also noted that the unit recovered N86.11 million as revenue into the federation account through the issuance of demand notices (DN) on Customs duties that were underpaid. “ In continuation of our anti-smuggling drive and protection of revenue loss, this unit had re-strategised its operations and re-injected new schemes to tackle the economic menace caused by recalcitrant importers and agents. We have harnessed our human resources and logistics for the prevention of economic sabotage,” he said.
