Jurors at the ongoing Old Bailey trial of former Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, his wife, Beatrice, daughter, Sonia and Dr. Obinna Obeta, yesterday, heard how David Nwamini, the alleged victim of trafficking, mentioned the Senator as the sponsor of his medical treatment to the United Kingdom (UK) in his visa application. He also stated in the form that Ekweremadu was sponsoring the £15,000 cost of the intended 28-day medical trip to the UK, beginning January 31 of last year. He also said in the form that the purpose of the trip was to enable him donate his organ to Sonia. In the visa application form, which was part of the evidence that the prosecution tendered at the court yesterday, Nwamini completed the “additional information” section as well, stating that he would be donating his organ to Sonia. “I will be donating my organ to my cousin, Sonia Ekweremadu, for her sacrifices to my family,” he wrote in the additional information section of the form.
Though earlier in the evidence, crown prosecutor, Hugh Davies, KC, noted that the “application is David Nwamini’s, whereas the contact email is that of Obinna Obeta.” In one section of the online form where he was asked, “if anyone is paying” for the planned medical visit, he mentioned the senator’s name. Asked “why?” He wrote: “Senator Ike Ekweremadu is sponsoring my visit to the UK to enable me donate my organ to Chinoso-Sonia.” At Friday’s hearing, former Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) national publicity secretary, Olisa Metuh, was among those in attendance to offer moral support to the Ekweremadus.
