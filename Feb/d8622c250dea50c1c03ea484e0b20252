Lionel Messi will miss Paris Saint-Germain’s Ligue 1 trip to Monaco on Saturday with a hamstring injury, raising concerns that he may not be fit in time for his team’s Champions League showdown with Bayern Munich next week. PSG confirmed on Friday that the Argentine World Cup winner had suffered the injury in the club’s 2-1 defeat against Marseille in the French Cup on Wednesday and would continue to undergo treatment over the next 48 hours. They added that Messi would return to training on Monday, the eve of the last-16 first leg against Bayern in Paris. The French champions are already without Kylian Mbappe for that game as he recovers from a thigh injury. PSG are eight points clear at the top of Ligue 1 before their meeting with fourth-placed Monaco in the principality.
