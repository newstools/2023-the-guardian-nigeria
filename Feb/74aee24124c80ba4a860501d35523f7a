Civil rights advocacy group, Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, (HURIWA), yesterday, expressed worry and disappointment over failure of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to use the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) machines in the accreditation of voters and uploading of polling units’ results for Ebonyi North Senatorial District in Saturday’s election. The rights group, therefore, urged INEC to cancel the election and re-conduct a transparent poll so that people of Ebonyi North can be allowed to make their democratic choice. HURIWA, in a statement by its National Coordinator, Emmanuel Onwubiko, said if such faulty exercise is not corrected by cancellation of that election, it means INEC has lost its credibility as an electoral umpire. HURIWA has also endorsed the petition by a former governor of the state and incumbent Senator representing Ebonyi North, Senator Sam Egwu:
The petition reads in part: “ I have been participating in all the electoral processes in Ebonyi since 1999. The 2023 general election is the worst case of brazen disregard and outright violation of guidelines, as well as rules and regulations of INEC on conduct of general elections in the state.”
