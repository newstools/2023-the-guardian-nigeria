Executive Chairman of Lagos State Universal Basic Education Board (LASUBEB), Wahab Alawiye-King, has said the state will not be left behind in the global push to increase female participation in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). While recognising that the participation of women in STEM is critical to the state and country’s sustainable development, he said that Excellence in Child Education and Learning (EKOEXCEL) recognises the crucial role of STEM in shaping the future and driving sustainable development. EKOEXCEL is the transformational primary education initiative of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, which he launched in 2019. “Addressing the gender imbalance in STEM was one of the reasons Governor Sanwo-Olu inaugurated EKOEXCEL in 2019 and we are happy with our strides. No nation grows without science and technology, and we have seen that to have an economy in tune with our megacity status, we have to encourage females in STEM. “Our female pupils are happy learning science and doing experiments. They continue to admit their joy in being taught in our schools where no effort is being spared to give them the best science education. Indeed, I am glad that EKOEXCEL is delivering on this front,” he said. Using innovative digital learning solutions, EKOEXCEL has prioritised girls’ education. It is empowering a new generation of confident, successful girls by promoting gender parity in education, opportunity and accountability.
