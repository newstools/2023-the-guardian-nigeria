Chairman of Lagos State Urban Forest and Animal Shelter Initiative (LUFASI), Desmond Majekodunmi, has urged Nigerians to examine political candidates for the 2023 general election and vote for informed and visionary people. He said this was important to ensure development in the country and reduce sufferings people are facing due to cash and fuel scarcity. Majekodunmi also appealed to Nigerians to remain calm, irrespective of the challenges they are facing, saying their mental health must be protected during the trying times. He said: “The cashless policies and change of currency notes are poorly implemented as it has brought untold hardship on the people. The policy has affected all strata of society. A lot of people are frustrated after long queues at petrol stations and Automated Teller Machines (ATM). Some are even seen passing the night at ATM galleries to get the new notes. “Nigeria is in dire need of servant -leadership, somebody that is God-fearing, educated, committed, patriotic and selfless leaders. Leaders who should be good role models and can turn the country’s economy around. “There is serious insecurity and other pressing issues in the country, and the current and past leaders have not really done well in addressing these issues the way they should. Nigeria is blessed with both human and natural resources; therefore, our leaders should look inwards to develop the economy. “Nigerians are tired of greedy, insensitive and corrupt leaders. The people must vote wisely this time around to deliver themselves from suffering and poverty.” Majekodunmi said the election is an avenue for the people to exercise their civic responsibility and contribute to the development of the country.
