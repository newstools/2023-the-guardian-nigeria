Ebonyi State government, yesterday, said it has appealed the Federal High Court judgment disbanding the Ebubeagu security outfit. At a media briefing in Abakaliki, the Commissioner for Information and State Orientation, Uchenna Orji, described the judgment of the Federal High Court as miscarriage of justice, vowing to resist disbandment of the security outfit. Orji said Ebubeagu operatives would continue to exist, noting that nothing can stop their operations in the state. He, however, stated that the court judgment had been appealed, and that the state will soon get a stay of execution. Recall that a Federal High Court, sitting in Abakaliki, in a judgment delivered by Justice Fatun Riman, had declared that Ebubeagu, which was established by the state House of Assembly, was illegal and unconstitutional. Justice Riman had, in his judgment, disbanded the security outfit, and called on Nigeria Police and other security agencies to disarm its operatives. .
