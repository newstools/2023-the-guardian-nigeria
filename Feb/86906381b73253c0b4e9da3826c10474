RITE Foods Limited is innovating to make consumers more satisfied. Recognised in ‘Africa 150 Report’ as one of the innovative brands, the firm has restated its commitment to making difference in the food and beverage sector. The Managing Director, Seleem Adegunwa, pointed out that research “is extremely important to the company and success of its brands that are manufactured in an ultra-modern factory with up-to-the-minute technology, with artificial intelligence, in line with global best practices.” He stated that the organisation’s quest for new ways of doing things was informed by improved service delivery to customers across the African continent. Adegunwa stressed: “Research is extremely important to us and we value that a lot. Our products are leaders in flavour innovation. On the Cola brand, there is a clear edge, and we lead in flavours. Our brands are enhanced by having many products under them, and that is a reason why they look bolder and bigger on the shelf.”
