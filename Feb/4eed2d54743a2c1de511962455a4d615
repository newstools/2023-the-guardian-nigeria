An underwriting firm, Mutual Benefits Assurance Plc, has provided personal accident insurance cover for 33 members of the Guild of Photojournalists with a total assurance of N99 million and supported the family of the late Photo Editor of The Guardian, Femi Kuti, with N250,000. With the policy, members of the association will paying yearly premium of N930,000 and are entitled to a compensation package of N3 million in the event of bodily injury. Speaking at the presentation ceremony, the Chairman, Mutual Benefits Assurance, Dr. Akin Ogunbiyi, said the decision to provide personal accident insurance cover to photojournalists is a result of the risks the professionals are regularly exposed to in the course of carrying out their duties. “Photojournalists are more exposed to risks in the line of duty. For us as an insurance organisation, it is our responsibility to provide an insurance plan that covers their members,” he said. In his remarks, the Chairman of the Guild of Photojournalists Nigeria, Abiodun Ajala, expressed delight at the scheme. “We are very grateful to the Mutual Benefits Assurance team for finding us deserving of this noble initiative. We have been exposed to several attacks at different times, which occasionally, lead to the loss of lives, temporary or permanent injuries, loss of equipment or other ills. We find ourselves at the receiving end of various cases of abuse. Still, we find a way to continue with little or no support from the organisations,” Ajala said.
