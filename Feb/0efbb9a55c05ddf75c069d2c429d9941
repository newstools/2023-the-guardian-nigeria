Suspected Boko Haram insurgents, yesterday, disrupted presidential and National Assembly elections in Gwoza Council of Borno State. Confirming the incident in Gwoza, the Emir, Mohammed Shehu Timta, said: “The insurgents struck by firing two mortar bombs into the township and injured five people, while casting their votes to elect leaders at the national level.” He said the injured had been evacuated and taken to Maiduguri for medical treatment. On how the border community with Cameroon was attacked, he said: “The terrorists came at 8:30 a.m., while the voters queued for accreditation before voting,” adding that when the incident occurred, many voters scamper to safety into various directions. He lamented that many voters refused to return, because there were no guarantee of their safety during the elections in the border community. “We are making efforts to convince them to return and cast their votes,” he said. He said the military and other security agencies have reinforced and chased the terrorists away into the Mandara Hills. The community is the hometown of serving Senator Mohammed Ali Ndume, seeking reelection on the platform of All Progressives Congress (APC) in Borno South Senatorial District.
