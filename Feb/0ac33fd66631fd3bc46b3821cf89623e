Petroleum Training Institute (PTI), Effurun, Delta State, weekend, warned its new students to hit the ground running in their academic pursuit, as they would not be allowed to buy their way through the institute. Speaking during the matriculation of 1,718 new students, the Principal of the institute, Dr. Henry Adimula, said: “Success in PTI will not come to you by buying your way through, as this is completely against our culture and practice in the institute.” He warned that students must meet 75 per cent attendance to qualify them to sit for examination. He said: “ Let me inform our matriculants that PTI is a centre of excellence in the petroleum industry in Nigeria. We provide leadership, best practices, research, support, and training for the petroleum industry. For this purpose, we have zero tolerance for examination misconduct, all forms of physical abuse, bullying, cultism, use of drugs, narcotics and drug peddling, certificate forgery, exposure of body parts and indecent dressing, stealing and misuse of social media.” He explained that the vision of the PTI is also to become the leading oil and gas technology institute in Africa, and that the mission is to provide competent technological human resources through quality training, research and consultancy for the oil and gas and allied industry. He challenged the students to proffer lasting solutions to the challenges in the petroleum industry, especially looking for new ways of exploiting fossil fuel with the aid of local and indigenous technology.
