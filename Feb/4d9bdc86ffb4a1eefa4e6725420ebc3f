Ude said this on Saturday while speaking with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja. He said that none of the candidates aspiring for any of the elective offices at various levels of government should boast of his or her ability to contest and win the elections without God’s grace. According to him, irrespective of power, position and money, leadership only comes from God who knows the hearts of men. “The only people that will succeed in their political pursuits are those that God has given grace to and are backed by Him.

“Irrespective of the money you have, irrespective of the name you have, you must lean on God and let him drive your ambition. “If God is not there in your political vehicle, the vehicle will crash, ” he said. According to the cleric, only God knows who is going to be the President, Governor, Senator and others. “But it is well with all the citizenry and anyone that God brought is God’s candidate and automatically our candidate, ” he said. Ude cautioned other spiritual and religious leaders, pastors and imams not to endorse any candidate based on sentiments and beliefs, but to pray to God for the right leaders to emerge at all levels of government.
