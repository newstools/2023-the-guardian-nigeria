Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPCL), yesterday, said the Port Harcourt Refinery will begin operation by the second quarter of this year. It hinted that the Warri and Kaduna facilities had been contracted for rehabilitation to reduce fuel scarcity and increase dependence on natural gas. The national oil firm’s Executive Vice President, Danladi Inuwa, made the disclosure at a sensisitation workshop, with the theme: “Understanding Our National Oil Company Post-Petroleum Industry Act,” organised by Tedran Consulting in Abuja. He noted that the event was to enlighten Nigerians on decision-making process of the profit-oriented company. Inuwa explained that by becoming a limited liability company, the organisation has been able to invest in infrastructure and initiate various corporate social responsibility initiatives to spur development, while ensuring energy security. In his remarks, president of Tedran Consulting, Olalekan Edwards, who spoke on citizens’ participation in influencing key project decisions in host communities, noted: “The accurate picture here is that we want to change the narrative from protest to participation. We, most times, address them at the after-effect of misapplication of funds or projects that are not developmental, hence the communities rise up.” “If you go to different host communities, you will hear issues that boil down to their development. We are placing a demand and we want to begin to participate in our affairs rather than just protest.”
