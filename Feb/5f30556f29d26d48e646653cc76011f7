It’s almost Valentine’s Day and Nigerian superstar Fadé has returned with something for lovebirds. Ignited Heart is a two-track single consisting of two love songs, Light My Fire, and Love Me which vividly depict what it feels like to fall in love and the beauty of requited love. The slow tempo of Light My Fire signifies the gradual process of falling in love while the more upbeat tempo of “Love Me” captures the energetic feeling that is brought about by requited love. Light My Fire is a passionate ode to a love interest; vividly portraying the passion felt towards them as a raging fire albeit in the midst of uncertainty that the love interest feels the same way. In Love Me, Fadé channels the way that requited love can make one feel; able to “see clearly” as her lyrics say. Both songs, which are inspired by both R&B and Soul music of the early 90s as well as alternative Afrobeats, have been written to focus the listeners on the sanctity of love in a chaotic world. Fadé, born Temilade Olaitan, is a Lagos-based Afro-Pop/ Soul singer & songwriter making her debut with her single “Kilode” which infuses elements of Pop and R&B into Afrobeats, to create an alternative sound. Since the age of five, she has been singing and performing on stage and has performed song covers at private gigs and parties. Her debut single, “Kilode”, introduced her unique sound to the world.
