The event, which held at the weekend at Rochas Foundation College, located at Summit Hills, near International Conference Centre (ICC), it was gathered, aimed at showing love to the less- privileged. It was tagged: ‘The Act of Kindness.’ Speaking during the ceremony, the Principal of the school, Dr. Regina Eneji, said the event was an initiative to show love to the less-privileged children in Rochas Foundation College. She said: “Why we are gathered here today is to show kindness. We were supposed to do it on February 14, which was Valentine’s Day, but due to contingencies, our founder said we should celebrate it today. We tag it:  ‘Act of Kindness’. 
“The aim is to support indigent children to have access to quality education and to demonstrate love and provide comfort to children of the less-privileged in all parts of the country.
“We are having a population of 270 and everything here is free from the uniform they wear to exercise books, pen. We only admit the less-privileged in the society, those that their parents cannot afford to pay school fees and the school is located across the federation.” she explained. One of the parents, who spoke on behalf of others, Mr. George Ekpo, thanked the Foundation for the show of kindness towards the children. He said: “We want to say thank you to the Foundation. Some of us cannot afford to send our children to school but with the help of this scholarship by Rochas Foundation, our children are enjoying this. And now they are also celebrating Valentine with the children, this is so kind of them, we appreciate them.”
