President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday decried the tragic murder of a number of Nigerian Muslim pilgrims on their way to Kaolak, Senegal, when the buses conveying them came under gun attack in Burkina Faso. The President, in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, expressed condolences and prayed for the safety of other Nigerians stranded in that country. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, through the Nigerian Embassy in Burkina Faso, is engaging with the Burkinabe authorities and awaits the outcome of their investigation of the unfortunate incident, and if necessary, to ensure that all culprits are appropriately sanctioned. The Nigerian Government will make every effort to secure the mortal remains of the deceased and the survivors of the attack, the statement added.
