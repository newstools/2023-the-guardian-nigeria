The Lagos State Government has prohibited truck drivers from using the Dorman Long and Ojuelegba bridges “in a bid to prevent further casualties” and directed the Traffic Management Agency to arrest truck drivers that passed through the routes. The Special Adviser on Transportation to the Governor, Sola Giwa, stated in a letter addressed to the Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA) that the state government has observed that the rising curve of the Ojuelegba bridge is not designed to allow the passage of long, spacious, and heavy vehicles. Giwa noted that the state government has therefore restricted articulated vehicles from using the Dorma Long and Ojuelegba Bridge routes in order to ensure the safety and security of the lives and property of citizens across the state. He added that truck drivers are to make use of the state logistics routes (Oshodi-Apapa Expressway) and under the bridge to link Ikorodu Road and then connect Agege Motor Road. “Sequel to the frequent road accidents along Dorman Long and Ojuelegba Bridges as a result of the activities of articulated vehicles resulting to loss of lives and property in the State and in a bid to prevent further casualties,” Giwa said. “it is imperative for the State Government to restrict the articulated vehicles from the Dorma Long and Ojuelegba Bridges their movement to the State Logistics routes (Oshodi-Apapa Expressway) and under the bridge to link Ikorodu Road then connect Agege Motor Road.” Giwa added that the state government has directed the state traffic management authority to probe any truck that violates this new directive. “In view of the foregoing, you are directed to apprehend articulated trucks that pass through Dorman Long and Ojuelegbe bridges in accordance with the pronouncement of the State Government, in a bid to reduce the spate of avoidable accidents occasioned by heavy duty and articulated trucks accessing the bridges in order to ensure safety and security of lives and property across the state.” The Guardian reported that two children and seven adult passengers died after a truck conveying a 20ft container fell on top of a commercial bus in the Ojuelegba area on Sunday, January 29.
