Says you can’t de-market state and expect our votes Governor Nyesom Wike has said it is absurd for the Peoples Democratic Party presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, to demarket Rivers State as unsafe, and ask the people to vote for him in Saturday’s election. The governor has declared that the Rivers electorate will cast their votes on February 25 presidential election for the candidate trusted to be committed to the unity of Nigeria. Speaking at Ogbakiri junction in Emohua Council, venue of the flag-off of the reconstruction and dualisation of Emohua Road to Abalama/Tema Junction, Wike said nothing could dissuade him and Rivers voters from the decision they have taken to that effect. Rivers State governor said the people summoned and addressed by presidential candidate of the PDP, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar in Abuja over the weekend are not true Rivers State citizens. If such people claim they are truly from the State, he challenged them to return home and be addressed by the presidential candidate as such. Wike described as unacceptable such summoning of people, who have made themselves non-indigenes in Abuja. According to him, it is an insult to Rivers State and its people for anyone who is seeking for their vote to summon them for a meeting outside of the state. Wike stated that if the PDP presidential candidate cannot come to Rivers State and address the people because he has labelled the place as unsafe, it would be morally wrong to seek for votes from the state. “You are addressing Rivers people in Abuja, is that not an insult? You cannot come to Rivers State and talk to us. You say Rivers State is not safe, but you want their votes. Rivers people, will you allow that? Those who declared our state to be unsafe are those who are seeking for your votes. It is unfortunate. No right thinking Rivers will take that insult.”
