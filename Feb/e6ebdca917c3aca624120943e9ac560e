Delta Central Senatorial Candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2023 election, Chief Ighoyota Amori, has said he will ensure equitable distribution of dividends of democracy across the eight councils of the district, if elected on February 25.
 
Amori, who was Delta State Commissioner for Education (1999-2003), facilitated distribution of three polytechnics in Oghara (Central), Ogwashi-Uku (North) and Ozoro (South).
 
His ministry also embarked on massive reconstruction of infrastructure and employment of teachers in both primary and secondary schools across the 25 councils of the state.  Amori began his mainstream politics in 1987, when he contested and won election as a councillor, and was later appointed as a supervisory councillor for Education in Ethiope Local Government Area in the then Bendel State from 1987-1989.
