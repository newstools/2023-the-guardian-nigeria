Betway Group, a leading global online betting and gaming brand, has announced the renewal of its national gaming licence by the National Lottery Regulatory Commission in Abuja, enabling its operations in all 36 states and 774 local councils in Nigeria for another five years. Director General of the Commission, Lanre Gbajabiamila, while presenting the renewed licence to the Betway team, commended the firm’s compliance to regulations guiding the gaming and betting category in the past five years. Gbajabiamila described Betway as one of the most compliant betting companies in Nigeria and assured the firm of a good regulator-business cordial relationship. Speaking at the event, Betway CEO, Anthony Werkman said: “We are honoured to have had the privilege of serving our Nigerian customers in a way that is consistent with our global practices by putting customer satisfaction and responsible gaming at the centre of our operations. We are truly grateful to the National Lottery Regulatory Commission for extending our licence in Nigeria. “As a brand, Betway considers regulatory compliance in any country where it operates as a primary responsibility and ensuring our customers are playing in a fair, safe, secure and responsible environment, will help us to continue to grow globally.” In his remarks, one of Betway’s Directors, Chris Ubosi, who led the team to receive the renewed licence, noted that the gaming company has long been well-regarded for its generous service to various Nigerian communities. These, he said, include donation of relief materials to flood victims in Bayelsa State, provision of potable water in Lagos, donation of several millions of naira worth of sports equipment to gyms across Nigeria and the provision of medical/finance assistance alongside the Lagos State Gaming Authority.
