Consolidated Hallmark Insurance (CHI) has flagged off a media campaign to sensitise Nigerians on the need to ensure the most valuable assets against unforeseen accident. The new campaign is tagged #IfYouLoveItInsureIt harps on the need to ensure that Nigerians and organisations who have spent huge amounts of money to acquire valuable assets provide insurance cover for their valuables. The underwriter encourages Nigerians to extend the love they have for their assets by protecting them against damages or theft. The Group Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of the firm, Eddie Efekoha, said the underwriter has embarked on an awareness drive for insurance of loved and valuable assets. He said that insurance remains a reliable fall-back option for the repair or replacement of such assets when the unexpected occurs. As we celebrate love, he said, the gift of insurance should be considered one of the best gifts to be purchased for our loved ones this season as it helps to lessen the financial burden when losses occur.
