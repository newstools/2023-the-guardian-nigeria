Presidential Candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Bola Ahmed Tinubu has appealed to the people of Lagos State to shun violence that can lead to the breakdown of law and order. Tinubu, who ruled Lagos State for eight years, said the outcome of the election in Lagos where the Labour Party presidential candidate Peter Obi won should not cause outrage among residents in the state. Obi, a former Anambra State governor, shocked political observers when he polled more votes than Tinubu in 20 local governments in Lagos.

As a democrat, you win some, you lose some. We must allow the process to continue unhindered across the country while we maintain peace and decorum.” He expressed serious concern over reports of violence in parts of the state.
