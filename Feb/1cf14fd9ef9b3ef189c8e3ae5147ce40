The endorsement, made at the Idumuje Ugboko country home of Nwoko, was witnessed by the nine NULGE council chairmen, which made up the senatorial seat. The chairmen include Comrade Ogwugwua Collins – Aniocha North; Nwaidei Micheal – Aniocha South; Nwabuzo Ephraim – Oshimili North; Oyana Kennedy –Oshimili South; and Ajusah Jude – Ndokwa East. Others are Opone Ikechukwu – Ndokwa-West; Alonu Sylvester – Ukwuani; Nwama Emmanuel Jolly – Ika South; and Memeh Nnamdi – Ika North East. The motion for the endorsement of Nwoko was moved by Collins, the Aniocha North NULGE chairman, seconded by Kennedy NULGE chairman of Oshimili South.
 
Speaking on behalf of the Delta North NULGE leadership, Collins said they resolved to back Nwoko because of his monumental contributions to the development of Anioma, the state and Nigeria in general. He said NULGE would also work for the election of all PDP candidates from the presidency, Senate, House of Representatives, to the House of Assembly. Collins said NULGE would organise a mass rally in the coming days to draw public support for Nwoko and other candidates of the party.  “NULGE decided to endorse and vote Nwoko because he is an illustrious son of Anioma. We know and respect him as an accomplished philanthropist, a man of integrity and service.
 
Responding, Nwoko said he was overwhelmed by the endorsement and pledged to “offer effective representation to the people of Anioma by protecting their best interests at the Senate.”
