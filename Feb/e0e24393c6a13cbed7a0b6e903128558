Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has said if the nation’s democracy fails and the country collapses, the judiciary, security agencies and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) should be held responsible. Wike, in a statement by his Special Assistant on Media, Kelvin  Ebiri, explained that there are enabling laws to safeguard the practice of democracy, especially as it concerns the conduct of the 2023 general election. The statement noted that the governor spoke while swearing in five Rivers State High Court judges and two Customary Court of Appeal judges.
Wike said it is incumbent on those agencies to do their duties by not succumbing to pressure from politicians in defence of the law. “I urge you to be firm, particularly this critical period when we are entering the transition period. I believe the legislature has done its part by making relevant laws to lead us. “As time goes on, there will be amendment, based on existing realities. But now, it is the duty of the judiciary, security agencies, and INEC to save this country. If this country collapses in this transition period, Nigerians should hold the judiciary, security agencies and INEC responsible.” Speaking to the newly sworn-in judges, Wike said a lot of responsibilities lie on their shoulders, particularly now that Nigeria is in transition from one administration to another.
