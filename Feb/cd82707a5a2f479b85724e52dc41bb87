Adediran, in a statement by Mr Gbenga Ogunleye, the Head, Media and Communications, JANDOR4GOVERNOR Campaign Organisation, on Saturday in Lagos, said that the purported campaign for Obi was a hatchet job. “The action carried out by some unidentified individuals in the party uniforms does not in any way represent the position of Lagos PDP in the forthcoming presidential election,”he said. Adediran noted that his ongoing campaign tour of the 245 wards in the state had always emphasised on the importance of voting for the PDP presidential candidate, former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar.

The candidate said that he had always emphasised the fact that Abubakar’s electoral victory would brighten his chances at the March 11 Governorship election in the state. Adediran disassociated himself “from such condemnable anti-party activity and promised that the perpetrator if by any chance are confirmed to be party members, will be sanctioned. “I enjoin all Lagos PDP members and the good people of the state to ignore the said video. “PDP members should remain resolute on their conviction to change the government at the federal level by voting massively for Atiku/Okowa ticket which promises to rescue the nation from the current hardship.”
