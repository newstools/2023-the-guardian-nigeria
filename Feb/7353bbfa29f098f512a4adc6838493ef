The Commanding Officer of Admin Battalion, Nigerian Army University, Biu, Lieutenant Colonel Julius Gidanmana Usman, has said the BIU Invitational Volleyball Challenge would be used to empower unemployed youths in Northeast, whose talents would be discovered at the event. Speaking while briefing the media on the Biu Invitational Challenge, Usman said the competition slated to hold from February 9 to 12 at the Nigerian Army University Volleyball court and the ABOGO Largema Cantonment in Biu, Borno State, is aimed at harnessing the potential in barracksâ€™ youths, which hitherto has remained untapped. The patron of Scorpion Spikers VC expressed optimism that the event would expose players to a high level of competition, adding that younger players stand the chance of getting selected by clubs ahead of the 2023 Nigeria Volleyball League. He said the current board of Nigeria Volleyball Federation, led by Musa Nimrod, is a strong advocate of developmental programmes and admonished the players to believe in themselves, develop their talents and engage in productive activities that would enable them to become self-reliant. The participating teams are Yelwa Spikers VC of Bauchi, Abogo Spikers VC of Biu, Boro Spikers VC of Kaduna, Adamawa Spikers VC of Yola and Rhino VC of Jos.
