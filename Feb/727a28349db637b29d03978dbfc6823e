***Says shift in election date won’t help APC candidate Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, has boasted that he would defeat the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) even if the election is postponed. The declaration was contained in a statement by the Atiku/Okowa Presidential Campaign Organization which advised the Tinubu/Shettima Campaign to end “it’s furtive scouting for the postponement of the February 25 presidential election”. The Atiku-Okowa Campaign organization said the generality of Nigerians reject the pressure by the Tinubu/Shettima Campaign for the postponement of the election. In a statement by the spokesman of the campaign, Kola Ologbondiyan, it was made clear that “the demand for postponement by the Tinubu/Shettima Campaign is a ploy to further create confusion and derail the electoral process”. The Atiku Campaign reminded the Tinubu Campaign of how the governor of a prominent North West State was said to have been humiliated at the last Council of State meeting where he reportedly went to push a failed memo for the postponement of the election for a few weeks. “Our campaign has also been reliably informed that this APC governor is demanding the postponement because the APC Candidate, Tinubu, cannot by any measure win the election, given his overwhelming rejection by Nigerians.” “It is pathetic that after its defeat at the Council of State meeting, the Tinubu Campaign is still perching around media platforms and seeking for the postponement of the elections,” Ologbondiyan said. According to the statement “having been stunned by the rejection at the meeting, the Tinubu Campaign had resorted to inciting violence, making wild, unfounded and reckless accusations, posting incendiary remarks, attacking prominent Nigerians, blackmailing and seeking to compromise our democratic institutions in order to heat up the polity and make it appear unconducive for elections to hold on February 25, 2023.”
