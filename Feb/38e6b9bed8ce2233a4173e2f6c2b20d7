The Lagos State government has said it is considering creating logistic routes for trucks and articulated vehicles as specified in the state transport master plan.  The Special Adviser to the Governor on Transportation, Sola Giwa, said that the stakeholders’ meeting was very germane because of the precious lives that were being lost daily due to negligence on the part of drivers and truck owners, saying as a responsive and proactive government, it will no longer condone unabated truck accidents resulting in the killing of innocent citizens. A representative of the Council of Maritime Transport Union and Association, (COMTUA), Adeyinka Aroyewun, called for genuineness and clarity of purpose by both parties in achieving the desired results.
 
Also, Chief Remi Ogungbemi of the Association of Maritime Truck Owners (AMATO), urged the state government to checkmate the activities of touts better known as area boys’ who have become a threat to the lives of its members.
