Endorses senatorial bid, other PDP candidates Expressing satisfaction with the development achievements of Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi’s administration in Enugu State and Enugu North Senatorial District, particularly in the university town of Nsukka, in line with the governor’s inaugural address, the people of Echara Nsukka Autonomous Community, on Monday, said they are grateful to the governor for being major beneficiaries of his good works in terms of infrastructure and empowerment. The people stated that Ugwuanyi, who is the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for Enugu North Senatorial District, deserves their commendation and votes for being the only leader from Nsukka zone who brought meaningful development to the area. They pointed out that no other leader from the zone, who had held government position in the past or currently in government, have been able to attract such remarkable developmental to Nsukka. The people added that Ugwuanyi, as a just and selfless leader, did not concentrate his development feats in his Udenu Council, but out of his passion and commitment for rapid development of Enugu North Senatorial District for socio-economic expansion, chose to concentrate most transformational projects in Nsukka. Speaking when the governor visited the traditional ruler of Echara Nsukka Autonomous Community, Igwe Christopher Ezugwu, at his palace, where people of the community, including elders, women and stakeholders endorsed the him for Senate and gave him a traditional blessing, the Commissioner for Local Government Affairs Peter Okonkwo, said that Ugwuanyi “holds the oat of justice against Nsukka elite conspiring against his good works.”
