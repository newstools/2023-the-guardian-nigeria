A woman and child have drowned and 33 people were rescued after a boat carrying migrants from Turkey sank off the Greek island of Leros, Greeceâ€™s coastguard said Sunday. The survivors, including six children, were transferred to hospital in Leros, with the rescue operation continuing, the coastguard said. Three rescue boats and a helicopter have been deployed but progress is being hampered by strong winds and choppy seas in the Mediterranean.
