• In new video, Buhari endorses Tinubu
• Atiku meets PDP National Assembly members, candidates in Abuja
• Save Nigeria from corruption mess by electing Obi, Ohanaeze begs Nigerians
• I’m reinvigorated by overwhelming acceptance, says Obi after campaign review President Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, drummed support for the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, saying “he is reliable and I know he will build on our achievements.” The President in the video message he sent from Addis Ababa, thanked Nigerians for electing him President for two terms, and urged them to vote for the APC flag-bearer. In the campaign message to voters, the President specifically put a call to “ traditional rulers, religious leaders and parents to warn their followers and wards alike, not to allow themselves to be used by a few to foment trouble. “I want to assure you that government has taken adequate security measures to allow everyone to come out and cast their votes. I am, therefore, appealing to everyone to give them the necessary support.
“I am not a contestant in this election, but my party, the APC, has a candidate in the person of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. As I mentioned before, Tinubu is a true believer in Nigeria, who loves the people and the development of our country. I am calling on all of you to vote for Tinubu. He is reliable and I trust he will build on our achievements. Having ended his political rallies on Saturday, presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, has started a new phase of consultation with party stakeholders. The former vice president scheduled a meeting to hold yesterday night with PDP members of the National Assembly and candidates in Saturday’s election. The meeting at Transcorp Hilton, Abuja was expected to provide the party’s flagbearer the opportunity to review the campaigns and preparations for Saturday’s election. Atiku is expected to follow up Sunday’s sessions meeting with other key party stakeholders in the remaining days before the presidential poll. Meanwhile, Ohanaeze Ndigbo has appealed to Nigerians to unite for the greater future of the country by voting for the Labour Party (LP) presidential candidate, Peter Obi, this Saturday. According to the Secretary-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro,” there is an ongoing battle between the corrupt elite and President Buhari, as there are attempts to bend the President to accept the elite’s covetousness and allow a particular candidate to win the election. “The North should know that it’s only Obi that will salvage the myriad of problems in the North and resuscitate the dwindling fortunes of the region. Those who are aged, without the stamina, will not be able to do the work. Rather than helping the North, they will aggravate and worsen the situation.
“Northerners should shun ethnicity and religion cards and choose competence, capacity, and character in the bid to end insecurity and banditry in the North, we are begging Northerners to choose Obi ahead of Atiku and Tinubu to save the country from the total collapse,” he said. Speaking on the presidential campaign, Obi has described his experience at rallies across the country as beyond expectation. He made this known yesterday after reviewing state-by-state the exercise that kicked off in Nasarawa on October 29, 2022 and rounded off in Lagos on February 11, 2023. Speaking to newsmen in Abuja, Obi said more than ever before, the resolve to lead the take-back Nigeria movement is far strengthened than before he embarked on the campaign. He said in all the states, he saw a people fatigued by failed governance, but looking very eager and willing to see a new Nigeria. Obi said rather than feeling fatigued and exhausted, the rally has reinvigorated his team and has become a propelling catalyst for Ahmad Datti and him, because Nigerians of all tribes, religions, regions, classes and sex are unanimous in their desire for a real change and a new Nigeria. “We saw poverty, which shouldn’t be for a naturally endowed nation like ours, we saw people denied compassion by their leaders. We saw energy and vitality being wasted, youths in their productive age wrongly deploying their talents because of lack of direction and engagement. “I saw poverty in the North, but I also saw untapped talent, underutilised and wrongly deployed energy, and also saw vast arable land, the country’s future gold and oil. “Our top priority remains securing and uniting the country, because without security there is nothing anybody can achieve and without harmony among the people, there cannot be meaningful progress.”
