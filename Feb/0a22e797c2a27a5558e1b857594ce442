Inter Party Advisory Council (IPAC) in Akwa Ibom State has commended the Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) in the state, Dr. Cyril Omorogbe, for his transparency by leading political parties in the state to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to inspect sensitive materials, ahead of Saturday elections. Stating that INEC is ready for the elections, Omorogbe urged the electorate to vote for leaders that would fix Nigeria. He stressed the need to vote for sincere leaders that will be abreast of happenings in the country and represent the masses’ interest. He also advised Nigerians not to listen to rumours and not to believe everything on the social media but to double-check and ensure they get genuine and factual information from the right sources. IPAC state Chairman,  Mr. Ubong  Emmanuel,  told The Guardian that political  parties were ready for 2023 elections and stressed the need for transparency and good working relationship as demonstrated by INEC in the state. Present at the inspection were state chairmen of  various  political  parties. IPAC said the transparency demonstrated by the REC has dispelled the rumour that INEC has started collating election results before the elections. He said: “We are happy with what the REC has done inviting us to inspect sensitive election materials kept here at CBN.  This shows transparency and readiness of INEC. It shows that all political parties can work cordially with INEC for free, fair, credible, violent free elections” IPAC urged INEC to provide a level-playing field for all during elections. He advised the electorate to participate actively and vote their consciences and shun money politics.
