RELIGIOUS and traditional leaders, under the umbrella of Interfaith Dialogue Centre, have called on candidates of political parties and their supporters to accept outcome of the Presidential and National Assembly polls in good faith. They appealed for calm and urged the stakeholders to join hands with the winners to move the country forward. Sheikh Nuraini Ashafa and Rev. James Mobel Wuye made the call during an interview with journalists in Kaduna, when they assessed Saturday’s presidential and National Assembly elections. They said: “Let’s unite and save our nation from avoidable anarchy in the spirit of our common humanity. We call on all and sundry to eschew all forms of violence emanating from the outcome of these elections and embrace one another in an atmosphere that will enable us to live in peace.”
