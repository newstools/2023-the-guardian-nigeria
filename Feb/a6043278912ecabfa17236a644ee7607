The two-day football competition organised by a group, Young Professionals For Tinubu (YP4T), for the All Progressive Congress (APC) Presidential Candidate, Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has been described as a success by the organisers. The final of the competition at the weekend between Rising Stars FC, Ikeja and hard-fighting Funfon FC of Badagri, saw the former winning 4-2 on penalties to take the title after a goalless regulation time. Depros FC of Ikeja defeated Amoros FC of Agege 2-0 to win the third place match. For winning the competition, Rising Stars FC won a N250, 000 cash prize, while Funfon FC and Depros FC got N150, 000 and N100, 000 respectively. Each participating team got an appearance fee of N50, 000, in addition to branded T-shirts and other consolation gifts. Awards for the best goalkeeper, highest goal scorer and fair play were also given to players. Chairman of YP4T, John Ikeotuonye, said that the organisers achieved the purpose of the championship, which was to enlighten the youths on the need to exercise their franchise by voting for a credible, reliable, capable and tested technocrat in the forthcoming elections. “The championship was put together to create political awareness among the youths and make them realise the importance of casting their votes for Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, who is the most capable person that will take over from President Muhammadu Buhari come May 29 this year,” he said. The Tournament Director, Alex Oware, said the competition was a huge success, adding that he was happy the organisers were able to achieve the aim of putting the football competition together. “I am very excited that we achieved our aim of organising this tournament because many youths came out to identify with us. And as a body, we’ll continue to carry out projects that will impact positively on the country’s teeming youths, who are leaders of tomorrow,” he stated.
