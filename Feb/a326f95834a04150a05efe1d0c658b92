The Supreme Court, yesterday, dismissed two appeals brought against the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its governorship candidate, Uba Sani, by Sani Mahmoud Sha’aban. The lawyer for APC, who is also the past chairman of Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Kaduna Branch, Sule Shu’aibu, in a statement in Kaduna, declared: “Finally, the two appeals, at the instance of Sani Mahmoud Sha’aban, against the APC, its gubernatorial candidate, Uba Sani, and INEC have both been dismissed this morning, bringing an end to the litigation that started at the Federal High Court, Kaduna Division, seeking to disqualify the gubernatorial candidate in the forthcoming general elections.” Sani Sha’aban, an APC governorship aspirant in Kaduna State and in-law to President Muhammadu Buhari, resigned from the party, last year.
He, subsequently, filed a suit at a Federal High Court in the state, challenging the legality of the May 24 primary that produced Sani as governorship candidate.
