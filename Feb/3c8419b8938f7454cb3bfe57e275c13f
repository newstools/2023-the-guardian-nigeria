To prevent recurrence, the Minister of the Federal Capital Territory, Muhammad Bello, has revoked land allocation of the area where a two-storey building under construction collapsed in Abuja last week. The Minister disclosed this in a joint statement signed by the Director of Press, Anthony Ogunleye and the Spokesperson of the Federal Housing Authority, Kenneth Chigelu, after a meeting between officials of both parties yesterday (today). The two-storey building collapsed in Gwarimpa Estate on Friday, trapping 24 people, killing three, while 21 others were rescued. He lamented the loss of lives and condoled with families of the deceased as well as directed that a compensation plan be prepared for victims. Bello assured that those found culpable in the incident would face appropriate punishment commensurate with the crime committed. “The FCT Minister and the FHA Chairman both regretted the loss of lives and commiserate with the families of the deceased while directing that a compensation plan be prepared for them. The meeting resolved that the investigation by the technical team is also aimed at strengthening the internal working mechanism of both agencies and that all those found culpable in the building collapse will face appropriate punishment commensurate with the crime committed,” the statement reads. He tasked stakeholders to avoid creating opportunity for such incidents in the capital city.
