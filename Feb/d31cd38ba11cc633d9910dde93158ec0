Lagos State government has implored residents to plan their movement away from the corridors of the rally for the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu. General Manager, Lagos State Traffic Management Agency, Bolaji Oreagba, stated, yesterday, that some roads would be shut, as Tinubu and other APC leaders embark on a procession from the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA) to the Teslim Balogun Stadium for the grand finale of the rally. In the travel advisory, Oreagba said Tinubu, APC leaders and supporters would process from the local wing of the airport to the stadium through Mobolaji Bank Anthony Way, Maryland, Ikorodu Road (Anthony, Obanikoro, Onipanu, Fadeyi), Jibowu, Empire, Moshalashi, Ojuelegba and Barracks. The LASTMA boss advised motorists driving from local airport to Maryland to use Kodesoh to Obafemi Awolowo Way to link Kudirat Abiola Way (Old Oregun Road) to Ojota to Maryland and connect their destination, while motorists from local airport to Ketu/Mile 12 should use Kodesoh to Obafemi Awolowo Way, connect Secretariat Road to Mobolaji Johnson Avenue (7-Up) to link Ojota Interchange to Ketu and connect their destination. “While the procession holds on the Main Carriageway on Ikorodu Road, the service lane will be available for use by the motorists without any hassle,” he said.
