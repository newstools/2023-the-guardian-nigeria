A Federal High Court, Abuja has adjourned the case involving legality of the appointment of Lauretta Onochie as Board Chairman of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) to March 14. The people of Ndokwa in Delta State had filed an application seeking to be joined in the suit. The new parties seeking joinders are: Parkinson Azagba, representing Ndokwa West Oil and Gas Communities in Ndokwa West Council of Delta State; Edwin Agha, representing Ndokwa East Oil and Gas Communities in Ndokwa East Council and Chinedu Ofulu representing Ndokwa/Ukwani Federal Constituency. The Itsekiri community had filed the suit, praying Justice James Omotosho to set aside the National Assembly’s confirmation of Onochie as substantive chairman of the interventionist agency. But the people of Ndokwa brought an application, praying to be joined in the case, insisting they are necessary parties, being an integral part of the oil-producing area and second largest producer of the product in Delta State, with considerable prospect to head the NDDC as provided for by the NDDC Act. At the last sitting, the court asked the plaintiff’s counsel, Ama Etuwewe (SAN), if he had an objection to the application for joinder and he said yes, even though he had earlier responded in the negative. Etuwewe said they have filed a written address in opposition to the application and was about to adopt it when counsel to the parties seeking to join, Evans Ufeli, informed the court that neither he nor the applicants have been served with the written address that the lawyer to the plaintiff sought to adopt. Ufeli was served the said written address in court. The judge, thereafter, adjourned proceedings to March 14.
