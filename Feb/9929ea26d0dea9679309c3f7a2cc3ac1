Advises Igbo to stay alert The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), in a statement, yesterday, disclosed that following intelligence report at its disposal, there are plans to attack the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, in the South East and blame it on IPOB, Eastern Security Network (ESN) or supporters of the Labour Party’s Presidential candidate, Peter Obi, known as the Obedient group. According to the statement signed by IPOB’s Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, “the IPOB intelligence unit, the M.Branch, uncovered a plan by unscrupulous politicians to cause crisis in the country against IPOB and Ndigbo all across the country.”
He said: “This group is planning to assassinate Atiku in the South East and claim it is done by unknown gunmen, ESN/IPOB or the Obidient group. “The attack will lead to revolt against Ndigbo nationwide. It will also lead to riots against Igbo in the Northern and Western regions.  Ndigbo will be massacred mercilessly, and their properties destroyed. Even supporters of Obi will not be spared in these areas.” Drawing the attention of South Easterners across the country to be careful and cautious, Powerful stated that the attackers’ plans are to turn other ethnic groups against Ndigbo and, possibly, thwart the proposed election process. The statement reads in part: “Ndigbo in Lagos and other major cities in Nigeria should stay alert. Plans to attack them have been perfected, which may consume a lot of people and properties destroyed. “The hatchet plan will be done in a way that the international community will blame Ndigbo for the crisis. “We advise every Igbo person to stay alert and take precautionary measures to defend and protect him or and herself. “The plan is to create confusion and pandemonium in every part of the country to scuttle the upcoming election.  We are warning the intending attackers to stay off, because their evil agenda will backfire and destroy them.”
