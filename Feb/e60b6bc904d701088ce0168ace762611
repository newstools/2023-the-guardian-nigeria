Flying Eagles Arrive Egypt, Ready To Conquer Africa Again
After a disappointing start to the 2023 Revelation Cup, the Super Falcons of Nigeria will be looking for a much-needed victory to bounce back to winning ways when they square off against Colombia this evening. The West African ladies will be going into the match after their disappointing 1-0 loss to Mexico in their opening game of the campaign, their sixth consecutive defeat. While this may dampen the team’s spirit, they must put it behind them and get the victory over Colombia to keep their hopes of progressing into the next phase of the competition alive. The Colombian women, on the other hand, will enter the contest after their 1-1 draw against Costa Rica in their opening game of the competition on Wednesday, and will also be looking for a victory over the Falcons to keep their hopes of winning the tournament alive. Slated for 8 PM at Estadio Leon in Mexico, it would be a determining match, as the winner would be progressing. Meanwhile, the Flying Eagles of Nigeria arrived Cairo, Egypt on Thursday night ahead of the 2023 Africa U-20 Cup of Nations. 20 players and their officials touched down at Cairo International Airport around 5:30pm local time. They will take on the Young Terangha Lions of Senegal in their first game at the Cairo International Stadium tomorrow. Before that, hosts, Egypt and Mozambique will slug it out in the opening fixture of the competition. The competition will run from February 19 to March 11.
