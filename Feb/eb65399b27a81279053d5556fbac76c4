Spokesperson for the anti-graft agency, Wilson Uwujaren, said Bello was docked alongside Abba Adauda, Yakubu Siyaka Adabenege, Iyada Sadat and Rashida Bello (at large) on 18 count-charge of criminal misappropriation and money laundering to the tune ofÂ  N3,081,804,654 The defendants pleaded not guilty to all the charges preferred against them. Following their pleas, prosecuting counsel, Rotimi Oyedepo (SAN), urged the court to give a trial date to enable the prosecution prove its case.

Justice Egwuatu, thereafter, adjourned the matter till February 13 and ordered that the defendants be remanded in a correctional centre until determination of the bail request.
