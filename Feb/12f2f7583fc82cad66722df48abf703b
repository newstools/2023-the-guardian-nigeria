The General Overseer, The Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) worldwide, Enoch Adeboye, has assured Nigerians that if they believe in God and surrender to his will, their suffering will turn to testimonies. Speaking on ‘Seasons of Wonders’ during the monthly thanksgiving service of RCCG at its Ebute Metta headquarters, yesterday, Adeboye also prayed for parents, children and other family members for abundant provision. Adeboye, through the Special Assistant to the General Overseer (Admin.), Dele Balogun, said the period of scarcity of fuel and cash calls for seasons of wonders. “God is ready to usher Nigerians into seasons of wonders, but Nigerians must wholly turn to God,” he said. Recalling a lot of divine interventions in the affairs of Nigeria when the country would have been thrown into chaos, the pastor assured that no matter the current situation in the country, there would be light at the end of the tunnel. He called on Nigerians to trust God and refuse to rationalise the situation, which will negate the principles of miracles. “Get your Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) and vote wisely without selling your conscience, which may jeopardise the future,” he added.
