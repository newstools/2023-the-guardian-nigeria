By mid-day, yesterday, collation of presidential election in Rivers State had not kicked off, as journalists, party agents, and civil society organisations waited endlessly at the conference hall of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in the state. The delay, which is not unconnected to non-availability of results from 23 councils of the state,  raised concerns.There was palpable tension as voters waited eagerly to find out if results reflected their wishes. Recall there was a huge turnout of voters during the election and voting commenced as scheduled in parts of the state while in other parts, there was late arrival of electoral materials, and violence in some other parts. In two riverine communities in Degema Council of the state, Tombia and Bakana, voting did not take place owing to logistics challenges; and in Ikwerre and Obio-Akpo councils, there were reported cases of ballot snatching.
