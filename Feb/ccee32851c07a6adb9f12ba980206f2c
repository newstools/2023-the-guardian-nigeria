The Governor of Niger State, Abubakar Bello, has expressed optimism that the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate in the state, Muhammed Bago, would emerge victorious at the poll. Speaking during a fund raising dinner and book presentation, held, yesterday, in Abuja, he explained that the choice of Bago as the party’s governorship candidate was in tandem with wishes and aspiration of people of the state. Calling on the electorate to vote en masse for the APC, he described Bago, who represents Chanchaga Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives as a steadfast person. He said: “The people of Niger have spoken, and I deliberately refused to get involved in the primary. Even with all the pressure to get involved, I said let the people speak. When you allow the will of the people to prevail, you would not have problems in the general elections. “You are going to emerge winner after the general elections insha Allah. You allow people to decide what you want. The people have chosen you. As we are now, as far as this project is concerned, I won’t be wrong if I say we are just waiting for time. “We need all the prayers and support. We brought you to support this process, and you will never regret it. For those of you that have the means to support this cause, it is an investment, which is worth it. “With determination and will of the people, we would make it. The problems would pass. All governors of Nigeria are concerned about what is going on. We feel for our citizens.” The National Chairman of APC, Abdullahi Adamu, said the party is ready, and has the capacity to win the coming elections. Adamu, who was represented by the Vice Chairman, North Central, Muhazu Rijau, called for support for Bago.
