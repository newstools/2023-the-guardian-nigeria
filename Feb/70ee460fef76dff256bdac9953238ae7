The award was conferred on Danbatta in recognition of the EVC’s effective regulatory achievements through cutting-edge initiatives, especially during his first five years in office during which Nigeria’s telecoms sector has shown spectacular landmarks. According to Vanguard Newspaper Limited, the organizers of the event, his initiatives strengthened the role of the telecommunications sector as a major contributor to the growth of Nigeria’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as well as telecoms investment inflows from $36billion in 2015 to over $70 billion. In a statement, signed by NCC Director of Public Affairs, Reuben Muoka, Danbatta also spearheaded a campaign to improve Nigeria’s broadband penetration from the paltry five per cent at the time of his appointment to about 30 per cent in 2018. The EVC is currently among those leading the charge for the realisation of the new national broadband penetration target of 70 per cent by 2025 since his reappointment in office in 2020.
  
While presenting the award, Chief Abiola Dosunmu, the Erelu Kuti IV of Lagos, said Danbatta was eminently qualified and deserving of the distinct recognition conferred upon him.
  
Other eminent Nigerians who have distinguished themselves in professional excellence and service to humanity in the private and public sectors were conferred with various categories of awards at the event including the President of Dangote Group, Alhaji Aliko Dangote, who won the Personality of the Year Award.
