As the general elections begin this weekend, Oodua Youth Parliament (OYP) has vowed to mobilise 10 million votes for All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, in the South West region. In a statement, yesterday, in Kaduna, its speaker, Aare Abdulmajeed Oladimeji Oyeniyi, said the former Lagos State governor has all it takes to govern the most populous black nation. To show seriousness, he hinted that the body had directed members in and outside Nigeria to act accordingly, stating:  “The APC presidential candidate will be congratulated before noon as president. “We have millions of members across the world and they will be coming home to vote Tinubu.” Urging unity among the Yoruba, Oyeniyi warned that any choice aside from Jagaban Borgu would be detrimental to the wellbeing of the nation. His words: “Any mistake not to choose Tinubu as Nigeria’s next president will be detrimental. He has all it takes to rule the country, being a detribalised Nigerian, who loves the masses and is blessed with enormous wisdom.” “Tinubu has a track record as (former) Lagos State governor and his unmatched humanitarian endeavours since 2007 when he left office. “Asiwaju has better qualifications, exposure and know-how to rule the country and his ideas too are rock solid. We can imagine him replicating his achievements in Lagos should he emerge as president.  I believe Nigeria will, again, become very relevant in the comity of nations.”
