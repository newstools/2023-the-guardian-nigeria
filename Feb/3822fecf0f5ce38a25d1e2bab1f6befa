Afro Nation, which will take place on the lovely Portimao beach from June 28 to 30, already has a star-studded line-up that includes, to name a few, Burna Boy, 50 Cent, Booba, Aya Nakamura, Fireboy DML, Asake, Arya Starr, Black Sherif, Oxlade, Dadju, and Ms Banks. The Star Boy himself has rejoined the group at this point. Wizkid, a multi-platinum-selling international sensation with a Grammy to his name, will perform a plethora of hits at Afro Nation Portugal with his smooth voice and addictive beats. Wizkid has joined Burna Boy, another Afro Nation 2023 headlining act, to become the first African artists to headline UK Stadium events in 2023. Meanwhile, Davido, who is renowned for his contagious hooks and contagious onstage enthusiasm, has established himself as one of the most original and interesting musicians working in Nigeria. This summer, when he returns to the stage amid much anticipation, look for another memorable performance that features the crowd singing along to his greatest hits. Little Simz, a BRIT Award-winning songwriter, will perform in the Algarve as well. She will enthrall the public with songs from her ground-breaking new albums “Sometimes I Might Be Introvert” and “NO THANK YOU,” as well as her timeless favourites like “Venom,” “101FM,” and “Boss.” Simz has been winning awards left and right lately for her constant bravery and provocativeness, and her upcoming Afro Nation debut is another moment to cherish. This summer, the legendary dancehall artist Popcaan will also arrive in Portugal and turn up the heat with his sultry hits like “Only Man She Want,” “Party Shot,” and “When You Wine Like That.”
