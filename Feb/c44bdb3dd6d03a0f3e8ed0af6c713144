Wembley Stadium, this evening, will host the Carabao Cup final between Newcastle United and Manchester United, as both teams contend for the first major silverware in English top-flight football. The game symbolises a battle between legacy and new order. A Saudi-led consortium acquired Newcastle in 2021; its new ownership has inspired a resurgence in form for the Magpies. They fought their way to a first final since 1999, thereby complementing their impressive form in the league. However, they will have to overcome a tough test against one of the traditional top six teams in England to announce their arrival as a new force. But, it would not be an easy ride. Their opponent, Manchester United, are desperately seeking to end a trophy drought that has lasted for five seasons. The Red Devils last won a trophy in May 2017 when they defeated their incumbent manager, Erik Ten Hag’s former club, Ajax in Stockholm. That season, under Jose Mourinho, United completed a double, having also won the Carabao Cup final against Southampton in February. Eddie Howe, Newcastle’s manager, will head into this tie with a goalkeeper selection headache. First-choice goalkeeper, Nick Pope, was sent off in their last league game against Liverpool, while second-choice goalkeeper, Martin Dubravka, is ineligible for the contest because he previously played for Manchester United at the third round of the competition. This leaves Howe with third-choice goalkeeper and Liverpool rejects, Loris Karius, for the crunch clash. The presence of in-form Marcus Rashford, who has scored 16 goals after the World Cup in Qatar, will serve as a further boost for the Red Devils. The return of suspended midfielder, Casemiro, will provide the much-needed steel for Manchester United in a match they desperately need a win.
