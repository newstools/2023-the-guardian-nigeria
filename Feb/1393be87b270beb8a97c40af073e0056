Ubani blames bad leadership for Nigeria’s woes Publisher of The Guardian Newspapers, Lady Maiden Alex-Ibru has called on Nigerians to be more security-conscious in the face of different challenges confronting the country and, above all, trust God for their maximum protection. She added that Nigerians should be very conscious of the choice of leadership and never to be biased in the coming elections, as she prayed God to take over the country’s leadership. The publisher spoke as a Special Guest of Honour yesterday at the Bible Society of Nigeria (BSN) Founder’s Day Lecture and Awards with the theme, ‘Credible Elections: A Desired Paradigm Shift and Pathway to Responsible Governance’, which held at Muson Centre, Onikan, Lagos. Guest Speaker at the occasion, Monday Ubani, narrowed down the problem of moving the country forward  to bad leadership, as Nigeria has been unlucky to be consistently run by bad leaders who are greedy and unpatriotic, turning the country to their personal property. He cited the Naira redesign policy, which has brought untold sufferings to Nigerians, adding that any policy, no matter the intention, that brings suffering on the governed, could only be made by bad leaders, who are not concerned about the citizenry. The human rights activist called on Nigerians to leverage the Electoral Act that has made some innovative provisions in terms of deployment of technology in the electoral process. He charged Nigerians to also improve the human factor by changing their parameters in the choice of their leaders, which had been dictated by primordial sentiments. The President and Board Chairman, BSN, Bishop Timothy Banwo, said for the country to move forward, Nigerians should elevate the God factor and believe in the Bible. General Secretary/CEO of BSN, Samuel Sanusi, said the event was organised to remember the good works done over the years by the founders of BSN and to award people who have done well in their works, as he solicited assistance to spread the Bible across the various languages in Nigeria.
