OLAM Agri in Nigeria has launched a baking academy to train and economically empower more women in the country.
  
The firm recently established a baking academy in Kano State to build on the pillars of the Seeds for the Future Foundation’s Crown Flour Angels (CFA) initiative.
 
Crown Flour Angels, an economic empowerment initiative of Olam Agri’s wheat-milling business Nigeria, aims to equip women with baking skills and enhance their earnings while enabling them to contribute meaningfully to their communities and the national economy.  Head of Marketing, Olam Agri Nigeria, Mrs. Bola Adeniji, explained that the launch of the CFA Baking Academy follows the successful facilitation of baking training for over 250 International Cake Exploration Société (ICES) women in Lagos by the business under the auspices of the same initiative.
 
According to her, “The launch of the Baking Academy offers a scaled support framework for women across regions; and the choice of Kano is strategic. The global bakery product market size was $397.90b in 2020. The market is projected to reach $590.54b in 2028. “This growth projection presents an opportunity for bakers, including graduates from our baking academy. We are proud to be launching our women into this prosperous market through our initiative.” Speaking at the event, the Emir of Kano, Alhaji Aminu Ado Bayero, applauded Olam Agri for locating the baking academy in Kano.
