Describing Ugwuanyi’s emergence as candidate to represent Enugu North Senatorial District in the National Assembly on the platform of the PDP is a fait accompli, the people stated that the governor’s movement to the National Assembly as a senator will bring enormous democratic dividends to their council in particular, and the district in general.
 
They declared that the smallest appreciation they would show to the governor is to deliver him at the poll.
 
In his speech, an elder statesman and party chieftain, Chief Maxi Ukuta, described Ugwuanyi as “a worthy son,” applauding him for carefully giving the people of Enugu State, Peter Mbah to succeed him as governor.
  
The elder statesman lauded the governor for the pressure and suffering he passed through to make Enugu an oil-producing state, stating that the governor, having done so, also established the State University of Medical and Applied Sciences (SUMAS) Igbo-Eno, thereby opening up the rural areas.
