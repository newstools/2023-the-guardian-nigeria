Labour Party (LP) House of Representatives candidate for Amuwo Odofin, George Adegeye, has promised selfless and qualitative representation, if elected into the National Assembly. During his electioneering, yesterday, he said having been raised within the locality, it is incumbent on him to invest his efforts and resources in ensuring a greater Amuwo-Odofin federal constituency. His words: “I was raised on this Mile 2 Estate; so, my antecedents are well known to many here, unlike those who had no root here. My late mother, Risikat Adegeye, while in the House of Assembly till 2007, lifted a lot of people.” So, it is somewhat innate in me to ensure the welfare of the people. I run a business with 125 staff strength, and it is doing great.” My venturing into politics is not for pecuniary reasons, but a will to serve.”
