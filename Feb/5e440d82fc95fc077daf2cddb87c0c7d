Group A leaders, Bendel Insurancae of Benin, are all but assured of a place in the 2022/23 abridged season-deciding Nigerian Professional Football League (NPFL) Super Six play-off. At the halfway mark of the season, Group B leaders, Lobi Stars of Makurdi; Enyimba of Aba, Sunshine Stars of Akure, Abia Warriors, Akwa United and Plateau United are also in contention for the play-off. In Group A, unbeaten Insurance, lead the table with 23 points from nine games, followed by Enyimba (16 points), while Akwa United (15 points) and Plateau United (14 points) are third and fourth respectively. Only three teams will qualify from each group. Group B, led by Lobi Stars with 19 points from nine games, has Sunshine Stars (15 points) in second position, with Abia Warriors and Rivers United, tied on 13 points, third and fourth respectively. The NPFL is on a three-week break to allow for the general elections slated for Saturday, February 25 and March 11 2023. According to the Interim Management Committee (IMC), the break will afford club players and officials chance to rest after a hectic first half campaign. The second stanza of the abridged league will commence on March 18. The 2022/23 NPFL season will end in May. MEANWHILE, the IMC has fined Shooting Stars Sports Club (3SC) of Ibadan and suspended one of the clubâ€™s official for allegedly behaving in a way capable of putting the game in disrepute.
