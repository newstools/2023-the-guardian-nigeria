President Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, condemned the gruesome killing of the Labour Party senatorial candidate for Enugu East Senatorial District, Chief Oyibo Chukwu, and his personal aide. The President believes that the perpetrators of this ignoble act, in Awkunanaw, Enugu South Local Government Area of Enugu State,
haveÂ no respect for human life and dignity, and therefore deserve the wrath of natural and divine justice. The President affirmed his avowed commitment to an election that is devoid of violence and rancor, reminding all political actors that it was the choice of the electorate that counts, and therefore, all eligible Nigerians should boldly exercise their civic rights without any fear of intimidation. The President directed security agencies to track down the culprits of the heinous crime, even as he commiserated with families of the victims, the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) and the Labour Party for the loss. President Buhari, in a statement made available to The Guardian by the Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, prayed for the repose of the souls of the deceased and comfort for those who mourn.
