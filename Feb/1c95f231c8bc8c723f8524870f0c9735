The Olowa of Igbara-Oke Kingdom in Ondo State, Dr. Francis Agbede, has denied reports by some blogs, which displayed his picture and details as Baale of Igbara Community in Eti-Osa Local Council of Lagos State, in a story accompanied by audio recording threatening and directing residents to vote a particular party in the coming general election. In a statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary (CPS), Ayodeji Owolabi, the paramount ruler denied being a Baale, and has nothing to do with the threatening viral audio. According to the report, the author also stated that the Lagos State Police Command had invited the monarch for questioning. Responding, Oba Agbede said the defamatory news item was unprofessional by its publishers. He called on the general public to disregard the damaging story, and urged the publishers, to as a matter of urgency, retract the publication and apologise for the embarrassment caused to the Olowa and his subjects all over the world by their defamatory news.
