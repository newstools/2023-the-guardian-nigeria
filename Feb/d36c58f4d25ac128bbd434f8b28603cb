Sharing his plans for the people during a tour of some markets on Friday, Nweke stated that politics and elections were no longer business as usual. “Politics should be about the welfare of the people. “In the case where a political party has failed to uplift you, the only option left is for you to vote them out and vote for people whose sole interest is to serve you,” he said. In response several traders reaffirmed their commitment to voting for competence and character in the coming election. They stated that their desire was to have a change in the state of affairs. Victoria Sylvanus, a trader, said they did not need any politician’s money. “We have suffered enough. We want water. We want good roads. We want a good governor like you, Frank Nweke Jr. We don’t want money” she said.
