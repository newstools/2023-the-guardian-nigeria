As the country inches towards the presidential election, the Oodua Youth Parliament, (OYP) has vowed to deliver 10 million votes for the All Progressives Congress Presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, in the South West. In a statement by the  Speaker of Oodua Youth Parliament OYP, Aare Abdulmajeed Oladimeji Oyeniyi said Tinubu has all it takes to rule Nigeria. Considering his activities and track record. He said the group has ordered all its members across the country to vote for Tinubu for president and he is confident that on the day of the election, “the APC presidential candidate will be congratulated before 12noon as president. “We have millions of members accross the world and they will be coming home to vote Tinubu.” While urging Yorubas not to divide its house before the presidential election, he warned that “any mistake in Nigeria’s choice of President if not Tinubu will be detrimental. Tinubu has all it takes to rule the country, being a detribalised Nigerian who loves the masses and is blessed with enormous wisdom. “Tinubu has a  track record as Lagos State governor and his unmatched humanitarian endeavours since 2007 when he left office as governor. “Asiwaju has better qualification, exposure, and know-how to rule the country and his ideas are rock solid. We can imagine him replicating his acheivements on Lagos in just 20 states should he emerge as president; I believe Nigeria will transcend into comity of nations deciding in the world.”
