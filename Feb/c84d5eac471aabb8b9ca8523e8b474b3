We did not receive directive to conduct polls at failed PUs, says official Again, scores of registered voters in Imo State were, yesterday, disappointed by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), as they waited for hours without seeing any official of the agency so that they can exercise their right. They include some polling units in Akwakuma, Owerri North, Mbaitoli Council, and other communities. Prospective voters said they waited till late on Saturday without sighting any official of the electoral umpire. Information was said to have filtered in from Chairman of the Commission, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, listing Imo as one of the states that would have elections conducted at the wards/polling units where there were no polls due to fault of the Commission. Prospective voters arrived their polling units about 8:00 a.m., and waited until few minutes to 5:00 p.m. before returning to their homes disappointed. An enthusiastic voter, Chioma, said she felt bad that she was not given opportunity to cast her votes for her preferred candidates.
She said: “INEC officials did not come to my polling unit in Mbaitoli Council on Saturday from 8:00 a.m. till 7:00 p.m. when I left. We later got information to return today. I came here about 8:30 a.m. and no body is here till now (about 5:00 p.m.) and I am tired and going back to my home. I am not happy I did not cast my vote this election year. All the sensitisation they gave us to come out en mass to vote; so, this is the outcome. Nigeria should change for better.” Responding, the Public Relations Officer (PRO) of the Commission in the state, Dr. Chinenye Chijioke-Osuji, said they were yet to receive any directive to that effect.
