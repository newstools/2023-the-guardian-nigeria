The Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola has insisted that the All Progressives Congress’ presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, is fit to rule Nigeria. Fashola explained that Tinubu has run the hardest presidential campaign, an indication of his fitness. Some Nigerians had raised the alarm over Tinubu’s health status. They alleged that the APC flagbearer lacked the capacity to rule the country. Featuring on Channels Television, Fashola, however, said Tinubu has run a very tough schedule. “We are running a democracy and there are people who have their view on who should and should not be the president,” he said. “What is the issue with Tinubu’s campaign? He has run the hardest campaign, he fought the toughest primaries. “Even after that, he was the one going around to embrace those he defeated, and that shows his leadership qualities, and he’s still campaigning. “I ask people if they can do some of the things he’s doing at his age and you are doubting his fitness. “You need to run his race first before you know if he is fit or not. You need to sleep the few hours he sleeps before you know if you can do what he does.”
