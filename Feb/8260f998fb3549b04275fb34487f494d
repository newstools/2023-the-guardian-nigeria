Ghanaian footballer, Christian Atsu, has been pulled from the rubble of a building ‘with injuries’ after the earthquakes in Turkey, his club’s vice-president Mustafa Özat has told Turkish radio. Atsu, who plays for Hatayspor, was trapped after the earthquakes that have killed at least 4,800 people. The Ghanaian forward, 31, played 107 games for Newcastle and has had spells with Chelsea, Everton and Bournemouth. Hatayspor sporting director, Taner Savut, is still in the collapsed building. Hatay was one of the areas closest to the epicentre of the earthquake, and has suffered extensive damage. “Christian Atsu was removed from the wreckage with injuries,” Özat told Radyo Gol.
“Unfortunately, our sporting director, Savut, is still under the rubble. Hatay was deeply affected. We are coming towards the end of the most dangerous hours.” Atsu, who won 65 caps for Ghana, joined Hatayspor in September 2022 after a season with Saudi Arabian team, Al-Raed. He scored the winning goal in the 90th minute of Hatayspor’s Super Lig match against Kasimpasa on Sunday. The Ghanaian Football Association tweeted: “We’ve received some positive news that Christian Atsu has been successfully rescued from the rubble of the collapsed building and is receiving treatment. Let’s continue to pray for Christian.”
