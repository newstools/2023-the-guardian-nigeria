 Members of Board of Trustees (BoT), executive members and other Alumni members, during the commissioning of the Late Olumide Biyi’s Legacy, as part of the founders’ day ceremony Although the 58th Founders Day Anniversary of Methodist High School, Arigbajo, Ogun State, might have come and gone, it left in its trail sweet memories, innovations and legacies that’ll linger for a long time to come.  “We have to envelope ourselves with the dream of new projects and donations as we give back to our foundation. I stand here today and deeply humbled by the confidence given to the executive members as we promise to continue to run faster, though we are yet to reach our peak. We need every member’s support.
“Excellence is never an accident; it is always the result of high intentions, sincere efforts and intelligent execution as it takes grit to achieve greatness. I appeal to all our great members to key into the construction of MEHSOSAI secretariat. The construction is in progress and the project still needs more cash for timely completion,” Oyegbami said. The chairman of the anniversary planning committee, Mr. Oluyinka Fashina, described the event as unique, being the year MEHSOSAI received award of excellence from ANCOPSS in the state for its support to the school, the commissioning of the Biyi’s building and the newly built stadium. The chairman of the anniversary’s organising committee, Mr. Oluyinka Fashina revealed that the ceremony would be a precursor to the 60th anniversary coming up in two years time. The event, according to Fashina, presented another opportunity for eminent old students to come together and share ideas that will make the school greater.
