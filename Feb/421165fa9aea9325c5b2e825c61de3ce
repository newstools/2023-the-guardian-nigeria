From heels to flats and kicks, regardless of gender, shoe preferences say a lot about a person. Shoe psychology shows the relationship between the footwear and human behaviour. It looks at how shoes can be used as a form of self-expression, as well as the cultural and social significance of different types of shoes. Researchers in this field explore how shoe choices can reveal information about a person’s personality, social status, or even their mood. Additionally, some studies also explore the impact of shoes on foot health and how it can affect overall wellbeing. In 2012, researchers at the University of Kansas stated that a person’s choice of footwear could determine his/her age, gender, income, political views, social status, and other important traits. The findings, however, were based on correlation suggesting that the preference of certain shoes does not necessarily cause a specific personality trait. Additionally, people’s shoe choices can be influenced by a variety of factors including, personal style, cultural and social norms, practicality and comfort. Therefore, it’s important to consider these factors when making inferences about a person’s personality based on their shoe choices. Guessing what your footwear says about you?
• Expensive shoes equal a high-income earner • Flashy footwear shows that the wearer is an extrovert • Practical shoes mean the person is agreeable: Old but well-kept shoes belong to a conscientious type of person: The Duchess of Cambridge must’ve been spotted in her favourite L.K. Bennett ‘Fern’ pumps over a dozen times now, but the nude-coloured courts look as clean and as tidy as the first few times she wore them in 2016. • Shabby shoes reveal a liberal thinker: Shabby-looking and inexpensive shoes, such as flip-flops and scuffed-up sneakers, give away a liberal-thinking wearer. • Ankle boots? These belong to an aggressive person. • Uncomfortable shoes are chosen by someone with a calm personality • Someone who prefers to wear new shoes is said to have attachment anxiety. • Boring shoes reveal someone who is aloof and repressive.
