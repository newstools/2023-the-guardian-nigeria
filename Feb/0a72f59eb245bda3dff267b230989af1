Organisers of the Bullet Energy Women’s Basketball Championship have confirmed that the event will hold in Asaba from March 14 to 18, 2023. The all-ladies competition, put together by Sam Oguche Foundation and sponsored by Bullet Energy Drink, will feature top women’s basketball teams in the country. According to the foundation, invited teams have been notified on the date and are stepping up arrangements to storm Asaba for the event. “We took into consideration all national and even international events billed for the month of March before settling for March 14. You know we had planned for February, but had to move it forward as we didn’t want teams travelling in between the election dates. “There was also the National Youth Games also planned for Asaba, but all that have been taken care of. We hope to give the players the quality competition they deserve and it is all worked out now,” Oguche said. Oguche said that winners’ cash prize has been raised by 100 percent, with overall champion now to get N2 million as prize money, against the N1 million paid at the last edition hosted by Lagos in November. “The Lagos event though was held for the men and women’s teams. The improved package means the runners up will get N1 million and the third placed team will earn N500k.” The Guardian recalls that the Bullet Energy basketball tournament began as a junior camp for young players in Onitsha, Anambra State, nearly one decade ago. Kwara Falcons won the men’s trophy in the last edition in December, while First Bank women team won the female category.
