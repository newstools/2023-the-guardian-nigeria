The Nigerian Navy have handed over a tanker vessel “MT Sea Eunice” arrested on August 11, 2022 to the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA).
  
The vessel is presently located along Escravos River, close to the Aroton community.
  
The Base Operation Officer of the Nigerian Navy Ship, Delta (NNS, DELTA) Commander Samuel Musa, noted that the vessel was constantly switching off her Automatic Identification System (AIS), which is a violation of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) regulation that NIMASA implements in Nigeria.
