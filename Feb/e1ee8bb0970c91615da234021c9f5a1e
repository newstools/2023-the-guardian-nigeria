Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Sadiya Umar Farouq, has disclosed that the ministry invested over N1.358 trillion in various programmes under its National Social Investment Programme (NSIP) since 2016. At the scorecard series of the President Muhammadu Buhari administration in Abuja, yesterday, Farouq said over 15 million lives have been impacted, since inception of the ministry, while the number of people below the poverty line has dropped since the current government assumed power. Giving a breakdown, she said the NPower initiative benefited about 186,123 Nigerians in Batch A, 312,479 in Batch B, 450,000 in Batch C and 439,998 in the last batch, with the amount spent totaling N890,717, 910,000 between 2016 and 2022. She said: “Under GEEP, the enumerated beneficiaries for Tradermoni were 59,996, Marketmoni, 92,587 and Farmermoni, 33,336. The amount invested, so far, was N17,629,950,000. Pupils fed were 9,990,862, and we have invested N200,999,500,000 on the National Home Grown School Feeding Programme. “For the Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT), we have 1,940,325 beneficiaries in our register: 101,475 rural women got the grant, 195,016 vulnerable groups also got the grant and 7,000 internally displaced persons were captured. The amount invested, so far, on CCT was N246,279,820,000.” She insisted that the entire process was transparent, as she did not influence states, schools or individuals that benefited from the different programmes. She added: “On how impactful the programme has been to over 80 million Nigerians, I will say that it was impactful to those we have been able to reach. The number was quite huge, amid limited resources at our disposal. We could only do our best. We wish we could make everyone comfortable in this country but that is not very possible.”
