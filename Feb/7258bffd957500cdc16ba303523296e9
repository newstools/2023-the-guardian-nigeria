The Lagos State Chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) New Generation, yesterday, disclosed that the presidential ticket of Atiku Abubakar and his running mate Ifeanyi Okowa is the best for Nigeria at the moment.  “To this effect, we all need to rally around the one person that is capable of rescuing us which is Atiku, hence our resolve to campaign vigorously for him.
“Our task has been made easy because Atiku is a man who is widely accepted in Nigeria and by Nigerians based on his antecedents, so, we are calling on all Nigerians to troop out en masse to vote for him and other PDP candidates during the election” he said.
  
Oluwaseyi led other Ward Coordinators of Lagos State PDP New Generation and youths in the Local Government Area to visit Ilasamaja, Isolo Area, Ago palace way, Ire Akari/Ishagatedo, among others, to interact with the electorates and share the Atiku/Okowa message with them.
