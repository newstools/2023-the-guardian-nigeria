Ahead of Saturday’s general elections, the National Women Leader of the Labour Party (LP), Dudu Manuga, has assured women that the party’s Presidential candidate, Peter Obi, will prioritize women’s empowerment towards lifting many families out of poverty. Speaking Monday in Abuja, Manuga described Obi as the only candidate who has raised so many people through capacity building and has proven to be a visionary leader. Noting that male politicians have over the years, marginalized women in politics, disempowered them in business and emasculated them when it comes to leadership, she expressed optimism that Obi would change the narrative if elected. “Obi has done credibly well in terms of policy implementation and his ability to build character and individuals cannot be overemphasized”, she stated. According to her, a vote for the Labour Party would equip women and girls to stand out in the global market through world-class education, training, and research which would enable the country to nurture more female achievers that will compete with the best in the world and represent Nigeria in the global market place. She maintained that Nigeria will move from a consumption nation to a production one, which according to her, will in turn create jobs for women and their children. She noted that all Nigerian women want is a country where the health sector works for everybody, and where the poor and rich get the health care needed. “We also want a country where women will not die again in rural areas because of childbirth, where we can travel peacefully without being afraid, where we can sleep with our eyes closed. We want a Nigeria where everything works, where our children will thrive.” Adding: “We want a Nigeria that recognizes that women exist; we want the five bills supporting the rights of women that were rejected by the National Assembly to be passed. That is the new Nigeria women want.
