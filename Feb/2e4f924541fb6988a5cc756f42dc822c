Hope PSBank, a Unified Payment Services Limited subsidiary, has commenced a community inclusion initiative to bring more people into the financial system. Speaking at a press conference to unveil the initiative, the Managing Director of the bank, Ogechi Altraide, explained that the initiative is targeted at promoting a cashless economy and ensuring that Nigerians, particularly, the unbanked, perform transactions through electronic channels across the country. She disclosed that the initiative would enable Nigerians to open Hope Wallet from their phones. The wallet holders could deposit their cash into the wallet at any agency-banking outlet in different communities across the country. She further stated that the bank has offered to give everyone a N500 cash incentive for opening the wallet, saying that all transactions can be performed using their phone numbers. “Hope PSBank is giving N500 to everyone that opens the Hope Wallet. The phone number is the wallet, account number, and ATM card. The phone number can be used to transfer money, make payments and withdrawals at PoS, ATM and Web”, she said.
