Super Eagles’ striker, Victor Osimhen, continued his title-winning form for Napoli at the weekend when he scored two goals to give the Serie A leaders a 16-point cushion in the race to the Scudetto. Napoli defeated Spezia 3-0 with wing wizard, Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, also on target. Kvaratskhelia put Napoli ahead from the penalty spot two minutes after the break on the Italian Riviera before Osimhen netted twice, taking his league tally to 16. Osimhen pounced on a defensive error to double Napoli’s lead in the 68th minute and five minutes later rolled home an easy finish after Mattia Caldara passed straight to Kvaratskhelia on the edge of his own area. “All the victories are important, we need to keep the momentum and try to win all games,” Osimhen told Sky in Italy. “It is not going to be easy of course, Serie A is a very competitive league and we have to be on top of our game. We go back, we prepare for the next game, that is the most important thing,” he said. Osimhen ended the day on top of the world after going into to the stands at the Stadio Picco to apologise to a woman fan he hit with an off-target pre-match practice shot. The 23-year-old hugged the woman and posed for selfies before going on to continue Napoli’s unstoppable looking title charge. “I think she was looking at her phone, the ball hit her in the face and I felt so sorry, as I didn’t mean to do that,” added Osimhen. “I had to show my appreciation and say sorry for that.” Luciano Spalletti’s side was expected to be at least 13 points clear come the end of yesterday as their closest challengers, Inter Milan, hosted ailing champions, AC Milan, in the day’s late match. Spezia stay 17th, five points above Verona, who are just inside the relegation zone and host Lazio this evening.
