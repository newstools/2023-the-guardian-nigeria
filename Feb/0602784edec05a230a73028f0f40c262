Analysts attributed the gain to investors’ sustained interest in MTN Nigeria (MTNN) (+1.7 per cent) and Dangote Cement (+1.2 per cent), even as the Month To Date (MTD) and Year To Date (YTD) returns increased to +2.0.per cent and +6 per cent, respectively. Cordros Capital said: “In the subsequent weeks, we expect the NGX to be flooded with corporate earnings as more companies publish 2022FY numbers, which will be accompanied by dividend declarations. “We believe this should provide a catalyst for buying activities even as risk-averse investors are likely to remain cautious due to medium-term expectations of an uptick in FI yields. “Overall, we advise investors to seek trading opportunities in only fundamentally justified stocks as the weak macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.” Analysts of Vetiva Dealings and Brokerage said: “Despite three red closes this week, the market recorded 21bps w/w gain, largely due to the gains posted in MTNN and Dangote Cement as the NGX30 index also gained 34bps. “For next week, we still anticipate mixed trading sessions, as investors remain cautious, amid slight profit-taking actions.” Furthermore, a total of 16,674 units of Exchange Traded Products (ETPs) valued at N11.9 million were traded in 44 deals compared to a total of one million units valued at N11.7 million transacted in 62 deals during the preceding week.
