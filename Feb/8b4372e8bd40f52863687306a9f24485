According to him, “No, they are not set free. Investigation is ongoing, and the IGP has formed a panel to investigate and submit a report within two weeks. So, we are on it.” The Inspector-General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba, had set up a special investigation team to commence investigation into allegations of extra-judicial killings, corruption, and high-handedness levelled against some police officers serving at the Zone 13 Command, Ukpo-Dunukofia and the Anambra State Command. An anonymous blog, Gistlover, had earlier published a story, alleging that Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP), Patrick Agbazue, a senior police officer in Anambra State was involved in kidnapping, torture, and murder of citizens. The blog further alleged that Agbazue and his team are worse than their infamous predecessor, James Nwafor, who was accused of similar crimes during his tenure as head of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad in Anambra. Reacting to the allegations on Friday, Adejobi said: “The IG has set up a special investigation panel under the IG’s Monitoring and Mentoring Unit to commence investigations into some weighty allegations of unprofessionalism, high-handedness, and extra-judicial killings levelled against its officers serving at the Zone 13 Command, Ukpo-Dunukofia, and the Anambra State Command on social media platforms.”
