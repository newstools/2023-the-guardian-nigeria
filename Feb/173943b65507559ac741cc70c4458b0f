Yesterday’s edition of La Gazzetta dello Sport analyses Victor Osimhen’s impressive performances for Napoli this season, drawing comparisons with Gabriel Omar Batistuta, Didier Drogba and Cristiano Ronaldo, writes football-italia.net. The Nigeria international is the best scorer in Italy’s top flight with 16 goals in 17 appearances, including two in the weekend’s round against Spezia. One of his two goals came with a header that saw the 24-year-old jump higher than Cristiano Ronaldo in 2019, when CR7 scored one of his most impressive goals for Juventus against Sampdoria. Osimhen is arguably Serie A’s best striker this season and has been compared to some of the best strikers of the last two decades, including ex-Fiorentina and Roma striker, Batistuta; Chelsea legend, Didier Drogba; Edinson Cavani and Samuel Eto’o. His goal against Roma in the last meeting with the Giallorossi at the Stadio Maradona in January was reminiscent of Batistuta’s great strikes in Serie A, noted G.B. Olivero. “It’s not just about power,’ explained the journalist.
“Osimhen, like Batistuta, is able to read every situation well and often finds himself in the best position to score.” Just like ex-Napoli striker, Cavani, Osimhen is always on the move and attacks the space like his notorious predecessor. The quality of his teammates, especially Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, does the rest. After the game with Roma, José Mourinho compared Osimhen to Drogba, but didn’t only have nice words for the Napoli striker. “He is of the same level as Drogba, but Didier didn’t dive,” warned the Portuguese coach. Gazzetta also notes that due to his physicality, it is hard to win duels with Osimhen, who also earned a comparison with Inter legend, SamueEto’o’o, thanks to his pace and ability to press the opposing defences.
