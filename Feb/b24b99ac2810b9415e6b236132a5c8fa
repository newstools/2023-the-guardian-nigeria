President Muhammadu Buhari has called for vigilance as winds and rising temperatures increase risks of fires in forests, homes, public buildings and markets. Buhari’s call is coming on the heels of an outbreak of a major fire incident, which has razed the popular Maiduguri Monday Market.  The president, who expressed grief over the destruction caused by the fire, yesterday, said the nation’s prayers and condolences are with the hardworking traders and their families, who have reportedly saved little or nothing from the fire. He commended the immediate response of Governor Babagana Zulum’s government to the incident, as he directed effective coordination and collaboration between federal and state agencies to bring relief to those who are affected. The president urged the state and federal agencies responsible for fire management to strive towards higher levels of preparedness, mitigation efforts and strengthening of their response mechanisms to deal with increasing menace of market and other fire disasters.
