Nigeria’s U-20 boys, Flying Eagles, have now settled down in Morocco’s commercial and economic capital, Casablanca, for a one-week final training camp ahead of the Africa U-20 Cup of Nations starting next week Saturday in the Arab Republic of Egypt. Head Coach, Isah Ladan Bosso and wards are staying at the Novotel Hotel in Mohammedia, just outside Casablanca, and the head strategist is upbeat about the readiness of his boys to sustain their winning mentality when the tournament kicks off in nine days. “We have been able to sustain the same mood we had in camp before going for the WAFU B U-20 Championship in Niamey, which we won. Since then, we have played a series of matches and scored plenty of goals, and that is immense for a winning mentality to stay within a team.
“However, we will not under-rate any of our opponents. Defeating Zambia in Abuja was good for confidence, but we know championship mood would be tougher. We will be ready to do the country proud.” Nigeria’s first match of the campaign, as they attempt an eighth continental title, will be against Senegal’s Cub Lions at the Cairo International Stadium starting from 9.00 p.m. Egypt time on February 19. The Flying Eagles, two-time FIFA World Cup runners-up and one-time bronze medallists, will then face hosts Egypt on February 22 (same time and same venue) and Mozambique on February 25 (same time and same venue). All four semifinalists at the 12-team championship in Egypt will qualify to fly Africa’s flag at the FIFA U-20 World Cup finals to be staged in Indonesia from May 20 to June 11 this year. In the Flying Eagles squad are Nathaniel Nwosu, Augustine Njoku, Solomon Agbalaka, Daniel Daga, Abel Ogwuche, Daniel Bameyi, Rilwanu Haliru Sarki, Nicholas Jonathan, Ahmed Abdullahi, Muhammad Aminu and Ibrahim Muhammad. Others are Benjamin Frederick, Emmanuel Uchegbu, Onuche Ogbelu, Jude Sunday, Akanbi Saheed Jimoh, Ayuba Francis Abubakar, Samson Lawal, Olamilekan Adams, Caleb Ochedikwu and Chijioke Aniagboso.
