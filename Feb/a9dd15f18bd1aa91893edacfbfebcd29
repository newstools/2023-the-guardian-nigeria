Lisabi Festival is the historic festival and cultural heritage event celebrated yearly by the Egba people of Ogun State in honour of the legendary Lisabi, a hero of the Egba liberation struggle from the dominance of the old Oyo Kingdom. The festival brings together Egba sons and daughters at home and from across the universe who converged on the ancient kingdom to honour their progenitors. Evangelist Obey-Fabiyi, the celebrated music legend and prominent Egba son, was in his usual best as he dished out many of his melodious evergreen oldies to which fun-seekers and entertainment lovers danced to and sang along with him. The ‘Chief Commander’ as he was popularly known on the stage, thrilled his audience for hours, leaving them with an unforgettable memory of a night of superlative excitement.
