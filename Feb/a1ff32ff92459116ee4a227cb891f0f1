Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, has charged journalists in the state to ensure peaceful and inclusive reporting of the 2023 general elections, warning them not to be used by politicians to fan embers of hate and disunity through hate speeches and derogatory comments. Obaseki gave the advice when he received members and executives of the Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ), Edo State, who paid him a courtesy visit at Government House, Benin City. A statement from the office of the Special Assistant to the State Government on Media Projects, Crusoe Osagie, quoted the governor as saying: “As media men and women, we have a role to play in helping, elevating, and lifting the conversation by focusing on the issues and stop trading abuses, and harassing people.  When people, who are not supposed to speak talk, we should step up and condemn them. When someone who has managed a state as a governor goes out and begins to preach violence, there is no justification or excuse for that. “We must lend our voices as this election will come and go. There will be winners and losers and Nigeria will continue. The will of the people will prevail in this election, as INEC is working hard to get it right. We pray for a free, fair, credible, and well-conducted election. We will all agree with the outcome when the result is announced.” Chairman of Edo NUJ, Festus Alenkhe, commended the governor for developing the state, reassuring him of the support of the media in ensuring all-round development in the state.
