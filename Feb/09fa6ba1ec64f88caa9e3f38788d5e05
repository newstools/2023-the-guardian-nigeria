The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), Osun Command, has trained its officers on standard operating procedure ahead of the general elections. This is contained in a statement by the acting Public Relation Officer of the command, Mrs Kehinde Adeleke, on Friday in Osogbo. The statement said Area Commanders,
Divisional Officers, Heads of Departments and Units, who would be deployed for the elections, were part of the training. It said that the training is in line with the vision of the NSCDC Commandant General, Dr Ahmed Audi, to strengthen the operational efficiency of the personnel of the corps ahead of the general elections. The statement also quoted the NSCDC state Commandant, Sunday Agboola, as saying that the training was aimed at establishing standard operating procedure for security personnel on election duty to keep them well informed of their constitutional roles during the general elections. Agboola also emphasised on the need to engage with other security agencies, noting that all security agencies were involved in the exercise. “The Nigeria Police Force is the lead agency, as far as elections are concerned in the country. We need inter-agency collaboration.
“Everyone is working towards a common goal, which is for the election to be free, fair and credible,” he said. The commandant also urged the officers to maintain neutrality, be apolitical, civil, approachable, respect human rights and also discharge their duties with high degree of professionalism. He said Nigerians were looking forward to security apparatus to ensure a peaceful conduct of general elections. “It, therefore, means that all hands must be on deck to justify the confidence reposed on NSCDC by members of the public,” he said.
Agboola also urged the trainees  to step down the training exercise to their subordinates, adding that the corps would leave no stone unturned to achieve a peaceful conduct of the general elections.
