Youths across Gombe State, under the auspices of Arewa for Tinubu, have embarked on a door-to-door campaign to canvass votes for Bola Tinubu, the Presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Mr Ibrahim Muhammad, the Gombe State coordinator, Arewa for Tinubu 2023, while speaking during the launch of the campaign in Gombe on Sunday, said the move was to get more votes for Tinubu. Muhammad said the group has over 5,000 members from the 11 Local Government Areas of Gombe State to carry out their campaign in the state. He said with the launch of the campaign, his members would embark on door-to-door sensitisation to ‘market’ the manifesto of Tinubu across the state and mobilise votes for a Tinubu and Shettima presidency. He stated that the move by the youths was also in view of the need to ensure continuity of the good policies and programmes of the APC beyond 2023. “From today, we are going from house-to-house to sell the manifesto of Tinubu, because we all know his positive contributions to the development of Lagos State. “Tinubu has proven to be a capable leader that can fix the challenges affecting the economy, security, education and other sectors. “Today, we are here to mobilise support for Tinubu’s presidency and the re-election bid of Gov. Inuwa Yahaya of Gombe State,” he said. The leader of the youth group said over 5,000 decampees from majorly PDP and other political parties were received into the APC to boost support for Tinubu and Gov. Yahaya and other APC candidates. He cautioned youths in the state and Northern Nigeria not to make the mistake of electing the PDP, adding “PDP is a waster; the party wasted our resources. “Tinubu has capacity to revamp the economy and make Nigeria greater for the benefit of all citizens.”
