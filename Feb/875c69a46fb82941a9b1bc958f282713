The pair had been dating off and on called it quit.  A representative for Mod Sun told the media that “They were together and engaged as of three days ago when Mod left for tour so if anything has changed that’s news to him.” However, neither Mod Sun nor Lavigne had made any public statements concerning the status of their relationship. After Machine Gun Kelly introduced them, the two musicians started dating when they released “Flames,” a single off Mod Sun’s album Internet Killed the Rockstar. In February 2021, Smith said of Lavigne, “We just spoke about music and we connected.” Because it’s f-king Avril Lavigne, it’s difficult to even say, but she said, “I really like your song, I really like your music.” In February 2021, Smith said of Lavigne, We linked up through just talking about music,” Smith told the media about Lavigne in February 2021. “It’s hard to even say because it’s f–king Avril Lavigne but she was like, ‘I really like your song, I really like your music.”
