A team of support groups based in Manchester, Britain, yesterday, pledged their support for the All Progressives Congress (APC) Presidential flag-bearer, Bola Tinubu and his vice, Kashim Shettima as well as Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu and his deputy, Obafemi Hamzat’s re-election in the 2023 general elections.
   
The groups, gave the assurances over the weekend during their convergence in London.

Adeoye added that they have started galvanising support for Tinubu since the commencement of the Permanent Voter Card (PVC) registration exercise, owing to their firm belief that Tinubu can overhaul the nation’s economy and all aspects of citizens’ lives for the better.
   
He said: “I welcome you to this auspicious occasion of the convergence of various groups in Manchester in support of the aspiration of our leader, Asiwaju Tinubu to become Nigeria’s next President and the re-election of Governor Sanwo-Olu in the forthcoming 2023 general elections.
   
“Our vision is to promote massive support for their emergence as President and Governor of Lagos State based on their track records of excellent performances both in human and infrastructural development.
“You will agree with me that those in the diaspora played a huge and massive role in terms of diaspora remittance, those of us that have family and responsible breadwinners believe it is important for us to be part of the process to have a Nigeria of our dreams.
“He is a progressive father of the nation and apart from that, he is somebody that has affiliations across all the six geo-political zones of the country. Regardless of what anyone will say, he is a man that has laboured for the progressive cause of our nation and he’s a man that has helped a lot of politicians and even professionals in the country.
