The University of Medical Sciences (UNIMED), Ondo, has received full accreditation from the Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria (MDCN) to graduate professional medical doctors. According to a release by the university’s Public Relations Officer, Temitope Oluwatayo, the approval followed the council’s visit to the institution in 2022 to ascertain available resources for the training of MBBS students. He added that the provisional approval of the council was conveyed in a letter signed by the Registrar, MDCN, Dr. Tajudeen Sanusi, addressed to the vice chancellor, Prof. Adesegun Fatusi. Oluwatayo added that the accreditation, as approved by the Council, is renewable every five years, subject to continued satisfactory evidence of the progressive development of the MBBS programme. “With this development, final year students of the MBBS programme at the university can now write their final professional examination and be inducted into the medical council.
“The focus of the management of UNIMED, led by the vice chancellor, Prof. Adesegun Fatusi, is not simply to succeed in accreditation processes, but to be an institution grounded in international best practices, and a hub of excellence in medical education and research that contribute to improved health and well-being nationally and globally,” he said.
