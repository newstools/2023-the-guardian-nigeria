Women Advocates Research and Documentation Centre (WARDC) has partnered with Ayisat Yusuf-Aromire Foundation to end Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (SGBV) across the country, using football. According to the Executive Director, WARDC, Dr. Abiola Akiyode-Afolabi, the partnership with the Foundation is to fight sexual and gender-based violence women and girls experience in football.
“Alarming reports across the world reveal sexual harassment, emotional and verbal abuse women football players experience often without workplace protections,” Akiyode-Afolabi said. Speaking further, she said a virtual campaign would be launched to highlight the voices of Nigerian women football players, who stand to end SGBV. Already, WARDC and Ayisat Yusuf-Aromire Foundation will host a novelty match in Ogun State between the Iyalodes/Iyalojas, and women football players. “This will bring community stakeholders in the fight against sexual and gender-based violence together. WARDC will offer psychosocial support and pro-bono legal services to SGBV victims or survivors referred by the Foundation,” she said. Former Nigerian International and founder of the foundation, Ayisat Yusuf-Aromire, said the partnership is to protect women’s rights and put an end to sexual and gender-based violence through football. “Football unites women and men. We are leveraging on the love for football to emphasize women’s issues like self-esteem building, sexual and gender-based violence, women’s political participation, and empowerment.” “We collaborate with communities to enlighten them on social norms and gender-based violence that still bar girls and young women from playing sports, political participation, education, reproductive health care and opportunities,” she added.
