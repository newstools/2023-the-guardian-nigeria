Federal Government has expressed commitment to regional maritime development, which is premised on cooperation of African countries in the Gulf of Guinea (GoG) to ensure optimisation of regional maritime potential. This is just as the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) has provided technical support to Instituto Marito e Portuaruo (IMAP) in São Tomé and Príncipe. The Director-General of NIMASA, Dr. Bashir Jamoh, who was represented by the Agency’s Director of Special Duties, Isichei Osamgbi, said it has become imperative for countries in GoG to help one another to ensure proper harnessing of the regional maritime potential. “It has become very pertinent for African countries to continue to collaborate and strengthen their relationships and helping one another in their areas of need for us to harness the vast opportunities we have to the best of our abilities. In the maritime sector, GoG is one area where that is most needed as encouraged by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO),” Jamoh said. He said evidence in the past has shown that when nations and organisations work together, each bringing in its areas of strength, they tend to develop faster and grow their economies better. On his part, Nigerian Ambassador to São Tomé, Gambo Hamza, commended the management of NIMASA, adding that the recent achievements in the Gulf of Guinea have improved the image of Nigeria in the country. He said considering that no nation can singlehandedly tackle transnational crimes such as piracy and trafficking in arms, it has become expedient for clusters of nations across the world to cooperate, join resources and fight criminal elements in waterways. He acknowledged NIMASA’s leading effort in the fight against piracy and ensuring the safety and waterways in the region.
