Therefore, I enjoin you to take a cue from them by performing the election duties with high sense of responsibility. “You are to ensure adherence to the guidelines contained in the Electoral Act and, especially, remain neutral throughout the exercise. As you get set to partake in this important national assignment, I would like to assure you that we have secured the commitment of the Independent National Electoral Commission and security agencies regarding your welfare and safety before, during and after the elections.” While warning the corps members against night journey that could put their lives in jeopardy, the DG said  “travelling at night will not only increase the risk of accident, but also make rescue difficult. You are, therefore, advised to always cut short your trips from six o’clock in the evening and pass the night at NYSC Lodges, military barracks and other locations officially designated as safe. “Furthermore, you should board vehicles only at approved motor parks so as to avoid falling into the hands of criminals.”
