Registration for the maiden Pan Africa Scrabble Association (PANASA)/Winifred Awosika Foundation Africa Youth Championship, which will happen from August 24 to 28 at Chrisland School, will hold next month. PANASA President, Adekoyejo Adegbesan, said the youth tourney is aimed at improving the standard of scrabble in Africa, adding that it is open to only African youths, who have the privilege of free registration for the event. He disclosed that over 10 African countries have so far registered for the tournament, adding that the title sponsor, Winifred Awosika, has promised to provide the needed logistics for a successful event. Adegbesan, who said that the competition is in two categories of U-15 and U-19, stated: “PANASA is delighted to host the inaugural African Youth Championship in Nigeria. “Helping African and Nigerian youths develop more interest in scrabble is my key target. We need more talents to be discovered. Hosting the Youth Scrabble Championship will help Nigerian youths interested in scrabble hone their skills among other African players. “The requirements for the youth championship are players that are 15 years and below as at August 24, 2023, who will be eligible to play in the U-15 category, while players 19 down to 16 years, as at the same time, will play in the U-19 category. “Accommodation and feeding of participants will be free, just as world scrabble body rules will be used in the championship,” he said.
