The Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), the Throne Room,  has embarked on a road walk to promote peaceful, free and fair 2023 general elections.
Members of the Church took the walk from Maitama towards the Federal High Court, back to Transcorp Hilton Hotel Abuja, where the church holds its weekly services.  “So, God has given us the power to choose, it depends on the choice of the people. At the end of the election, we will see who the people have chosen for themselves.
 
“We want  a leader who is responsible, someone who has a burden for the nation, we want someone with sense of responsibility. We are praying for someone who is connected to the country by heart, not just a section of people or tribal and religion.”
 
Other pastors, alongside Pastor Benjamins-Laniyi, gave talks from the Bible, prayers and declarations were made for peace within Nigeria  and prosperity in the country.
