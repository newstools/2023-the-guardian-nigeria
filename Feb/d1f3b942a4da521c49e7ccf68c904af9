Download logo Kenya has made significant progress in its fight against the HIV/AIDS epidemic, with a 53% decrease in new infections since 2010 and over 60% reduction in related deaths. This progress was acknowledged by UNAIDs Executive Director Winnie Byanyima during a courtesy call with the Ministry of Health Cabinet Secretary Dr. Susan Nakhumicha.  The Cabinet Secretary emphasized Kenya’s commitment to playing a key role in the global response against HIV/AIDS as the newly elected Vice Chair of the UNAIDs Board. Despite the achievements made so far, the Cabinet Secretary acknowledged the worrying trend of increasing new HIV infections among adolescents and young people and mother-to-child transmission of HIV at 8.9%. The declining external funding for the HIV response was also noted and the need for sustainable financing solutions to manage the large cohort of over 1 million people living with HIV on treatment was emphasized. Kenya is exploring solutions such as local manufacturing of essential commodities, Universal Health Coverage, and digitization of health services as a priority for the government. The UNAIDs Executive Secretary expressed her appreciation for Kenya’s commendable efforts and looked forward to working with Kenya as a leader in the region. She said the upcoming 52nd meeting of the UNAIDs PCB will focus on reducing health inequities and addressing the needs of key populations, including transgender individuals. Together, we can work towards ending the AIDS epidemic and ensure a brighter future for generations to come. Distributed by APO Group on behalf of Ministry of Health, Kenya.
