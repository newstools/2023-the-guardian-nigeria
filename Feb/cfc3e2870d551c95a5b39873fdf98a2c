Examples include spatulas, tongs, whisks, and cutting boards. They should be kept clean to prevent the growth of bacteria and other harmful microorganisms, which can cause food-borne illnesses if consumed. Additionally, clean utensils can also help to prolong their lifespan and maintain their functionality. Easy ways to keep kitchen utensils clean include washing them in hot, soapy water immediately after use, using a brush or sponge to scrub away any remaining food particles, and rinsing them thoroughly before drying them with a clean towel or air-drying them. Avoiding the use of abrasive cleaning tools and materials, such as steel wool or bleach, can also help to maintain the integrity of the utensils.
