Players from across the country have converged on Kaduna, venue of the Nigeria Volleyball Federation (NVBF) President’s Beach Volleyball Cup, which began yesterday. The competition will end February 19 at the Ahmadu Bello Stadium, Kaduna. According to NVBF Technical Representative, Martin Melandi, the tournament will feature junior and senior categories with the aim of discovering and grooming more young players. He said the NVBF leadership is working round the clock to ensure the players get adequate preparations ahead of the forthcoming African Games in Ghana, as well as other championships. “The Federation has begun its yearly programme with this cup. No stone will be left unturned in ensuring the beach players get more playing time. “Nigeria has dominated West Africa in the junior and senior categories and it is time for us to claim back our dominance on the continent. We will be attending a series of international championships like the African Youth Games, African Games and African Beach Volleyball Championship, not forgetting the Olympic Games’ qualifiers. “We intend to not just go there to make up the numbers, but to win. We will provide an enabling environment and more playing time for the athletes to excel,” he promised.
