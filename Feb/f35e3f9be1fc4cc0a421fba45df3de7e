Chief Medical Director (CMD), Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH), Ikeja, Prof. Adetokunbo Fabamwo, has said the medical outreach to residents of Ojokoro Local Council Development Area is a way of giving back to the community and to promote the THEMES agenda of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu. At the medical outreach, yesterday, in Ojokoro, the CMD noted that successive governments developed LASUTH into one of the best teaching hospitals in the country. According to him, Sanwo-Olu has made a lot of investments into the manpower, infrastructure, equipment and technology of the hospital. Fabamwo said: “At this very crucial and critical time, we felt the need to come and use our advanced skills and knowledge to the benefit of Ojokoro people. It is a specialised eye screening for the two common diseases that could cause blindness, if not detected early.” He added that after screening, proper treatment would be given to the patients at the hospital sponsored by Friends of LASUTH (vendors and contractors) “When you screen, you must be ready for the outcome. We’ve made arrangement for the treatment of positive cases – those to be treated medically and surgically. Part of our budget has been reserved for that. So, whosoever we pick will come to Ikeja for the free surgery,” he added. Executive Chairman, Ojokoro LCDA, Hammed Tijani, commended LASUTH for the initiative and promised to support, while urging the residents to make use of the opportunity. The traditional ruler of Ojokoroland, Oba Rilwan Taiwo, expressed gratitude to the organisers of the outreach, noting that the community welcomed the opportunity to get free health check. Director of Clinical Services and Training, LASUTH, Prof. Adebowale Adekoya, remarked that the Sanwo-Olu administration brought development in the state’s health sector.
