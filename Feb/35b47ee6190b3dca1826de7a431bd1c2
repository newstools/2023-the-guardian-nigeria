A Kano Upper Shariah Court sitting at Filing Hockey, yesterday, granted appeal of Asiya Ganduje, daughter of Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje of Kano State, for dissolution of her 16-year-old marriage. Asiya had approached the Islamic court seeking to divorce her husband Inuwa Uba on the ground that she’s no longer interested in the marital affairs that produced four children. Delivering the judgment, the Sharia Judge, (Khadi) Halliru Aliyu declared that Asiya reserved the right and decision to relinquish her marriage on the condition that she would be ready to return her dowry. Khadi Aliyu insisted that since the plaintiff has agreed to return the considered amount of N50, 000 as dowry to her husband, the court cannot compel the marriage to hold. The court also dismissed Uba’s claim and demand for documents of properties he insisted belong to him and upheld the submission of Asiya  not to relinquish the ownership to her ex-husband. Counsel to the plaintiff, Ibrahim Nassarawa, expressed satisfaction with the declaration of the court, assuring of Asiya’s readiness to fulfill all orders of court, including returning of N50, 000 dowry to her ex-husband. Counsel to defendant, Umar I. Umar, regretted that a union that has lasted for 16 years and yielded four children would be terminated without recourse to the negative consequences. He however said his client would decide on the outcome and take next option.
