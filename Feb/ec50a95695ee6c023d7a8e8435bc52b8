Major oil marketer, Mainland Oil and Gas Company Limited, has accelerated petrol retail services in its over 54 stations across the country.
The company has also slashed the prices of the product at its retail outlets even at a time most other marketers have taken advantage of the prevailing supply crisis in the market to make huge profits. Managing Director of the company, Dr Chris Igwe, stated  the company has remained steadfast to regulatory compliance on pricing in line with its commitment to partnering the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited in taming price distortions in the domestic energy market. He said the domestic fuel market requires disciplined players who must stick to existing regulations on sustainable supply, reliable services and stable prices. He explained that Mainland Oil values its unwavering reputation in disciplined and responsible operations above temporary jump in margins. A survey of the filling stations across the weekend showed most major marketers in the country sell a litre of petrol at the range between N195 in the Southwest zone and Abuja; N200 in North Central zone; N205 in South South zone; N210 in North West and South East zones; and N220 in the North East zone. To reduce the time spent by customers at Mainland Oilâ€™s retail stations across the country Dr Igwe stated that the management of the company has directed all its station managers to stretch service hours across the night to ease the pressure in the market and allow night travellers access to fuel. Igwe acknowledged the expenditure concerns expressed by most marketers over long hours of services, saying that the cost of fuelling uptime at numerous filling stations at a time of high cost of diesel is huge.
