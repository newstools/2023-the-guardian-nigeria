Wife of the presidential candidate of Labour Party (LP), Mrs. Margaret Obi, has called on the electorate to vote for candidates with capacity, character, and competence to redeem Nigeria and ensure the better country everyone is yearning for. Also, the National Treasurer of LP, Mrs Oluchi Oparah, has advised  voters in search of  better and greater Nigeria  to vote in the right candidate with antecedents,  history of good governance and someone without any dent. While Oparah bared her mind in an interview with The Guardian, Obi spoke  in a town hall meeting in Uyo, with the theme: “Women for a New Nigeria”.
 Obi, who called on Akwa Ibom people to vote for their son-in-law, Peter Obi, insisted it is only a man of integrity and track record, with no record of embezzlement, such as Obi, that can redeem Nigeria.      She said her husband is contesting because he has the capacity, integrity and proven character. She said: “God has presented us with a unique opportunity and we must do our part to collectively birth the Nigeria we want to see. A new Nigeria is possible, and with your participation, a new Nigeria will be born at the election polls on February 25.” “When Peter Obi is voted into power,  there will be no strike in our tertiary institutions,  women will be empowered, more than 35 per cent will be given to women because Obi is gender-friendly because he believes women are better managers. He will ensure security, qualitative education and accessible health care. We need a leader that will work for the interest of all.” Oparah assured the people that the Naira redesign will not affect the elections. She said: “How can an oil-producing county, a supposed giant of Africa be paying for fuel through their noses and the government of the day is not doing anything. With or without the general election, the hike in the pump price of fuel is absurd and shouldn’t be.”
