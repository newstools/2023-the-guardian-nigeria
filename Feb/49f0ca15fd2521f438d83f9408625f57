Nigerdock has completed the first phase of its shift to renewable energy sources through the installation of solar solutions at the Snake Island Integrated Free Zone. Speaking on the initiative, the Chief Executive Officer, Nigerdock, Maher Jarmakani, said the solar power expansion is the next step in the company’s journey towards green port status and highlighting its vision and commitment to Nigeria’s Climate Change Act, the Blue Economy and the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. Jarmakani said the renewable energy solution will provide the company and its growing clientele with consistent power and greater ease to conduct business. According to him, this project is part of a wider push by Nigerdock to develop 20MW of sustainable, cost-effective, and reliable power within the free zone. “As a self-sustaining economic hub, improving our energy consumption and reducing our carbon footprint is pivotal to our long-term operations and success. “Current solar operations enable Nigerdock to displace 40 per cent of its daytime energy consumption, reduce CO2 output by about 2,000 metric tons, and achieve significant emission reduction targets,” he said.
