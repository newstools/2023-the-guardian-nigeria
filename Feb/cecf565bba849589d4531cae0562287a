Reigning champions, First Bank, MFM, Tap Queens, War Queens, Peace Academy and Impression Basketball are among teams listed for the Bullet Energy Basketball Invitational Tournament, which holds next month in Asaba. Also listed for the women tournament are Divine Speed, Discover, Delta Force, Black Gold and Air Warriors. Speaking on the competition, Chief Executive Officer of Bullet Energy Drink Worldwide, sponsors of the event, Harmeet Ahuja, urged the teams to arrive in Asaba with all optimism, promising that the competition would be one of fun for the ladies. Delivering Ahuja’s message, yesterday, Sam Oguche, whose Foundation is organising the competition, said: “The last time we played in Lagos, it was a combined competition for the men and women, but it is something very different in Asaba and so promises to be special. “Bullet Energy Drink has been very committed to the game of basketball and the CEO (Ahuja) has made it very clear that it is not going to be different this time and wishes the clubs well as they compete in Asaba,” Oguche, a former national guard, said in Lagos. He said the tournament would begin as soon as the country rounds off with the gubernatorial election in the various states of the federation, adding, however, that the schedule has been tweaked a little and will now hold from March 14 to 19 for comfort and team safety reasons. Last month, the organisers and sponsors announced N2 million as the cash prize for the winners, with second and third placed teams to get N1 million and N500, 000 respectively.
