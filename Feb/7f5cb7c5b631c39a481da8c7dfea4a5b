Some experts in technology on Friday urged all tiers of government and corporate organisations to engage technology in the promotion of their businesses to attain digital economy. The experts made the call at a panel session with the theme: ‘Collaborate to Innovate, Leveraging Technology and Partnership to Grow’ at the ongoing 2023 Edition of AfricaNXT. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that AfricaNXT, formally called: Social Media Week, is an annual event held in February. This year’s theme is:  “Cooperate, Collaborate, Innovate, Unlocking Our Potential, Ensuring Africa’s Prosperity”. The Co-Founder, 9ijakids, Titilope Adewusi, said that collaboration was the new trend that allowed one to do bigger things that ordinarily could not have been possible. Adewusi said that leaders of businesses and social initiatives should bring development through transfer of knowledge, exchange of resources and other possible value projects for Africa’s economic benefits. She said that leveraging on technology as enabler would make collaboration seamless because it would bring about more solutions to challenges. Yvonne Awosanya-Adefajo, Content Director, WiMo Publication, said that on the wings of technology, businesses could fly. According to Awosanya-Adefajo, technology improves efficiency while collaboration amplifies the solution. She said that collaboration would not affect each other’s businesses because Nigeria was a big market. She said that Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) was a form of collaboration because businesses step into a society to address the needs of that society. Mr Micheal Ojo, Founder, Octave Incorporation, said that Africa was behind in terms of digitization, adding that was why big technology companies needed to align to accelerate digital skills. The event, which started on Feb. 6 ended on Feb.10.
