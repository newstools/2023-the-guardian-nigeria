• Enyimba hit El Kanemi twice Gombe United at the weekend halted Bendel Insurance’s 100 per cent start to the season, holding the Group A leaders to a goalless draw in a Nigerian Professional Football League (NPFL) matchday six game. The Benin Arsenal had won all  their five games of the 2022/23 season, home and away, prior to Saturday’s clash at the Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium, but they could not find a way past the stout defence mounted by Gombe United. Abia Warriors did not find their game against Dakkada of Uyo that tedious, as they walloped their host 4-2 at the Nest of Champions. Emmanuel Onu started the victory dance for Abia Warriors in the 27th minute. John Peter made it 2-0 early in the second half, before Dakkada cut the lead in the 65th minute through Emmanuel Ayoas. But Felix Aniekwe restored Abia Warriors’ lead in the 79th minute, but a resilient Dakkada FC reduced the tally again through Aniekan Ekpe in the 84th minute. Any hope Dakkada had of ending the game on equal footing was extinguished by Monday Yakubu in the 90th minute to end the game 4-2.
