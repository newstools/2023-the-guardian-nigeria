Former Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) National Chairman and Minister of Defence, Dr. Bello Haliru, has called on all contestants of this year’s general elections to accept defeat and avoid violence after announcement of results by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). He gave this advice while fielding questions from journalists in his country home after casting his vote in Birnin Kebbi. He added that violence cannot resolve crisis, rather due process should be followed to address legal tussles. He said: “I want to categorically tell politicians to eschew any political difference during the election period. Politics is a game of luck and any loser should accept defeat.” Bello also predicted that the PDP would win all elections across the country due to the fact that people are tired of the rulings All Progressives Congress (APC). He commended the efforts of INEC and security agencies for conducting free and credible elections. “I applaud President Muhammadu Buhari for this year’s election policy as it has brought sanity into out elections, as well as the monetary policy.”
