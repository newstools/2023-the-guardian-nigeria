The armed thugs stormed the INEC office around 09.30a.m. and started assaulting people, which forced election observers, journalists and INEC officials to run for dear lives.

One of the victims, a journalist from the area, Sale Nasko, said the suspects were believed to be members of one of the political parties. Meanwhile, Kano South Senatorial candidate of New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), Kawu Sumaila, said at least one person was killed and another injured during the attack.
