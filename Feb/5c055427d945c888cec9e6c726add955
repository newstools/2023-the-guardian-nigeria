•As Adamawa United, Queens reject offer The Adamawa State All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate, Aishatu Binnani, has donated a Toyota Sienna bus to the state chapter of the Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ) and 72 other faith-based organisations. However, two state-owned football clubs, Adamawa United and Queen’s Football Club management did not accept their two buses. While speaking at the distribution ceremony of the vehicles, Binnani said it was part of her empowerment schemes, which she initiated when she was a member House of Representatives. She pointed out that her empowerment schemes are majorly targeted at youths and women. She noted that the state would be great if youths and women are trained in skills acquisitions. The APC governorship candidate, expressed confidence that if the party’s presidential candidate, bola Tinubu, wins the election, Nigeria will return to its past glory of being the giant of Africa. In his welcome remarks, the state acting Chairman of APC, Samaila Tadawus , urged the people of state to vote massively for Binnani for more dividends of democracy.
