Zamfara State Government has ordered all Non-Governmental Organisations (NGO) to leave the state over alleged illegal activities fueling insecurity. The directive is contained in a statement by the state’s Commissioner for Security and Home Affairs, Mamman Tsafe, on Tuesday. The commissioner stated that some of these NGOs have been found engaging in activities that fuel insecurity in the state and its environs, as well as failing to register with the state in accordance with laws and regulations. “It is further noted that the majority of these illegal NGOs have not registered with the state in line with the laid down rules and regulations of government. Some of them have also been found to be engaging in activities fueling insecurity in the state and its neighbourhood,” Tsafe said. He also added that all government ministries and departments have been instructed to cease any further associations with any NGO, stating that punishment will be taken against any MDAs found to have such relationships. “Henceforth, the government orders all NGOs in the state to pack their belongings and leave the state immediately. Ministries and Departments of government have been ordered to stop any further relationships with any NGO, as punitive measures will be taken against any MDAs found having any relationships with such NGOs.” Tsafe, however, directed all state security agencies to be vigilant, investigate, and prosecute any NGOs operating in the state without legal permission from designated authorities. “Security agencies in the state are by this announcement directed to be vigilante to the NGOs. Security agencies are hereby directed to investigate and prosecute any NGOs operating in the state without due clearance from designated authorities. Results of such prosecutions are to be forwarded to this Ministry for records please.”
