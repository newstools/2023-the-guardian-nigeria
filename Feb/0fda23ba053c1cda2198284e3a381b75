The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) will, today, complete the presidential and National Assembly elections in seven councils in Abia State. The state INEC Administrative Secretary, Clement Oha, who announced this to journalists, yesterday, at INEC state headquarters, Umuahia, said the exercise followed skirmishes and discrepancies that cropped up during Saturday’s polls, which the Commission insisted must be addressed through fresh polls for real and credible results to emerge. He said the things that would ensure successful polls in today’s exercise have been put in place in all polling units in the seven councils, which he listed as Obingwa, Osisioma Ngwa, Aba North and Aba South, Umuahia North, Ohafia and Arochukwu. On results of Saturday’s polls, he said that while some were ready and others getting ready, the collation of results would follow after completion of today’s election.
