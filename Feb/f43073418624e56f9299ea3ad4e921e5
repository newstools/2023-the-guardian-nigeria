Download logo As representative of the President of the Republic Abdelmadjid TEBBOUNE, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and National Community Abroad, Ramtane LAMAMRA, took part today by videoconference in a high-level meeting on governance in Africa organized under the auspices of the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM).  The meeting, held as a prelude to the 36th African Union Summit scheduled to take place in Addis Ababa on February 18 and 19, was devoted to the consideration of evaluation reports submitted by several African countries, including Lesotho, Chad, Comoros, the Republic of Guinea and Sudan, with a view to finalizing the APRM's annual report on the state of governance in Africa. In his remarks, based on Algeria's firm commitment under the leadership of President Abdelmadjid TEBBOUNE to the values enshrined in this pan-African mechanism, Minister LAMAMRA stressed the need to revitalize the role of the APRM as the main tool for joint African action to prevent conflict and promote democracy and sustainable development. In response to the regression of good governance in Africa and the risks this presents to peace and stability on the continent, LAMAMRA has advocated a comprehensive approach that focuses on harmonizing the efforts of the African Union and sub-regional communities, strengthening preventive diplomacy, and appropriating and promoting continental instruments of good governance, such as the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance. The APRM was created in 2003, following the establishment of NEPAD by the five founding countries (Algeria, South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria and Senegal). The APRM is a self-assessment instrument to which the member states of the African Union voluntarily adhere in order to promote good governance, political stability and sustainable development at the continental level.
