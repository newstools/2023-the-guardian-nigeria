Grace Ojoko, a landlady of a storey building near a gas dispensing outlet, Nelmic Gas plant, at Effurun,  in Uvwie Local Council of Delta State , escaped death by whiskers, when the gas plant exploded on Monday night. 
 
Although no life was lost in the incident, dozens of people who gathered near the plant when the fire started, however, suffered burns.
   
The large storage tank exploded and landed on a storey building across the road and narrowly missed the landlady of the building who was sitting on the balcony.
 
The elderly landlady told The Guardian that she was lucky to be alive.
