The Premier League’s referee chief, Howard Webb, has contacted both Arsenal and Brighton to apologise for ‘significant errors in the VAR process’ following controversial decisions on Saturday, reports standard.co.uk. Ivan Toney’s controversial equaliser for Brentford at the Emirates Stadium was allowed to stand, while Pervis Estupinan’s opener at Crystal Palace was disallowed due to “human error,” the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) confirmed in a statement. Toney’s goal meant that Arsenal dropped points in their pursuit of a first league title in almost 20 years before Manchester City faced Aston Villa yesterday. Lee Mason, the VAR for the London derby, “forgot” to draw the lines which would have shown Brentford’s Christian Norgaard in an offside position before assisting the goal. A similar problem has been used to explain Brighton’s disallowed goal. A statement read: “PGMOL can confirm its Chief Refereeing Officer, Howard Webb, has contacted both Arsenal and Brighton and Hove Albion to acknowledge and explain the significant errors in the VAR process in their respective Premier League fixtures on Saturday,” the body said in a statement. “Both incidents, which were due to human error and related to the analysis of offside situations, are being thoroughly reviewed by PGMOL.”
