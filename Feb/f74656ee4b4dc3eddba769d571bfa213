• Carriers impose 300% fare regime, N1.8m charge to amend old tickets
• Nigeria loses 5% passenger charge as travellers now buy tickets from neigbouring countries, abroad
• Lawyer petitions minister as NCAA, FCCPC keep mum   • Travel agencies closing down, NANTA cries out Apart from naira scarcity, foreign exchange liquidity crisis rocking the nation’s air transport sector has taken another ugly turn with foreign airlines tacitly refusing to sell tickets in statutory local currency.  Nigeria was estimated to hold the lion share of $551 million; Pakistan, $225 million; Bangladesh, $208 million; Lebanon, $144 million and Algeria, $140 million.
  
IATA’s Regional Vice President for Africa and the Middle East, Kamil Al-Awadhi, had warned that countries that keep foreign airlines’ funds in the local economy would be exposed to dire consequences, which include, a downstream effect of 200 to 300 per cent fare hike.
 
Though an intervention by CBN led to a pledge to release $265 million in August, leaving a balance of $200 million, the situation has remained the same. Indeed, the stranded funds keep piling by daily sales of tickets, to warrant Emirates Airlines quitting the Nigerian route in October 2022. As at the last check, industry sources said the current accumulation is well over $560 million.  “The torrents of the attendant denunciation, at such an audacious attempt by Nigeria to denigrate their sovereignty, would reverberate rebuke globally. Nigeria must be accorded the same deference,” he said.
 
The CEO of ALC added that companies accorded the opportunity to conduct business in Nigeria were obligated to respect its sovereignty.
 
“Any adverse stance constitutes an act of hostility and is unequivocally unacceptable. The imposition of such reprehensible terms of payment is a brazen affront to the nation and citizenry granting those enterprises the privilege to transact business in Nigeria. It is patently unconscionable and a departure from the essence of corporate social responsibility.
 
“It is incumbent on the government to incisively excoriate this ignominy and assure the preservation of the nation’s sovereignty. In this governmental responsibility, citizens must remain hopefully assured,” the petition read in part.
