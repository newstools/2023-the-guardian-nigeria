Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has extended 2023 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination  (UTME) registration by one week, beginning from yesterday (Wednesday). By the extension, sale of ePINs is ending on February 20, while registration terminates on February 22. Earlier schedule had ended on February 14. According to Head, Public Affairs and Protocol, Fabian Benjamin, 1,527,068 candidates have successfully registered for this year’s test, inclusive of 168,748 applicants, who indicated interest to take the Mock-UTME at the close of sale of ePINs on February 14. The organisation said: “It should also be noted that the Board, based on its projections, had expanded its capacity to register up to a hundred of thousand candidates daily. With this, it was possible to register all desiring candidates within the space of a few days. However, less than 50,000 candidates were turning up for registration, which is less than the installed registration capacity. “Surprisingly, in the last two days before the closing date, the pace picked up remarkably with over a hundred of thousand candidates registering on a daily basis. “Furthermore, the Board, as a responsive and proactive agency, took cognisance of the reports from across the country indicating some difficulties being faced by many Nigerians in using their electronic channels to purchase the ePINs or obtain cash readily within the stipulated period.” It has, as a consequence, granted this extension to ensure that all candidates, who desire to register for the 2023 UTME, are given the opportunity to do so, especially when the extant challenges are not of their own making.”
