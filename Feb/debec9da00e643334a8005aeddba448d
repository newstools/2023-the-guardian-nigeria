Gives Umahi 48 hours to stop attacks on opponents Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA), yesterday, commended disbandment of the South East security outfit, Ebubeagu, in Ebonyi State by a Federal High Court in Abakaliki, last week.
  
HURIWA, in a statement by its National Coordinator, Emmanuel Onwubiko, lamented that the state governor, David Umahi, has turned the state security outfit, which was created to protect residents against oppression by armed herders, amongst other marauders, to political attack dog to oppress and repress opponents, especially non-members of the ruling All Progressives Congress in the state.
  
The civil rights advocacy group issued a 48-hour ultimatum to Umahi to discontinue attacks targeted at political opponents in the state or he gets ready for mass action at embassies of western nations, which may impose visa restrictions on him and his family for undermining democracy and freedom of association in the state, as well as the entire South East. The court, on Tuesday last week, had ruled that the disbandment of Ebubeagu was the  consequence of several alleged human rights abuses, extortion, illegal arrests and use of firearms by its operatives.
