A suspected thug, identified as Idris, has been alleged of raping a Muslim woman inside a mosque in Iwo Road area of Ibadan, Oyo State. The development has triggered protests in the area.
It was gathered that the incident happened on Sunday, when the suspect assaulted the woman. Youths, scholars and organisations in Ibadan thereby stage a protest to demand prosecution of the suspect. The concerned Muslims were led in the protest by an Ibadan-based Islamic cleric, Sheikh Amubieya. A source said: “An unfortunate incident happened in Ibadan, when the son of a road transport union member sneaked into a mosque and raped a woman. This prompted the concerned Muslim leaders to stage the protest on Monday.” Another source confirmed to The Guardian that the suspect has been arrested. The source said: “The thug who raped a Niqobite (Muslim lady in veil) has been identified as Idris, also known as Kesari. He is the son of a union leader known as Al-Majiri. He was arrested by the police and the case has now been transferred to the State Criminal Investigation Department (SCID).”
