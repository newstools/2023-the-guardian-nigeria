Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), has assured Nigerians that the attack on its office in Anambra State on Wednesday won’t deter it from conducting the forthcoming general elections. The commission office in Idemili South Local Government Area (LGA) was attacked and set ablaze by unknown gunmen on Wednesday. National Commissioner and Chairman of, the Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, who confirmed the attack in a statement, said the building was substantially damaged. According to her, all furniture and other items were destroyed, including non-sensitive materials recently delivered in readiness for the 2023 general election. He added that among the items lost to the inferno are 729 ballot boxes, 243 voting cubicles, 256 election bags, 11 megaphones, 1 electric power generator and large quantities of indelible ink and liquid gum. He, however, said uncollected Permanent Voters’ Cards (PVCs) kept in the fireproof cabinet were not affected by the inferno, adding that no sensitive materials have been delivered to the LGA office. He said: “The destruction appears to have been coordinated as the Nnobi Police Station in the LGA was similarly attacked. “Despite this despicable incident, the Commission wishes to reassure the people of Idemili South LGA that contingency arrangement will be made to replace the materials and the Presidential and National Assembly elections will proceed on 25th February 2023 as scheduled, to be followed two weeks later by the State House of Assembly election.”
