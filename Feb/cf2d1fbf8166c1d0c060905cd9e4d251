No fewer than 42 Nigerians will benefit from the maiden Nigeria Rugby Football Federation (NRFF) Level 1 Medical and WADA Training Course, which began on Wednesday at the Media Centre, Moshood Abiola Stadium, Abuja. The federation had earlier organised a seminar and workshop for coaches and referees, where participants were certified to further improve the development of the game in the country. The federation said the three-day medical and anti-doping seminar, which will train officials and other Nigerians, ends on tomorrow with 44 participants from all the geopolitical zones of the country. It said that a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) accredited educator will educate participants on day one, while Dr. Rotimi Akinola, another WADA accredited educator, will take on the last two days. Speaking on the readiness and gains of the training, president of the federation, Dr. Ademola Are, said: “The NRFF is ready to receive all the participants. Everything is in place, including the venue and facilitators. It is important that players and coaches are well informed because we don’t want our players to run foul of the law. “Participants will be certified after the course and will also be kept abreast of the laws guiding anti-doping, how to avoid them and know what drugs and food players should take or avoid.” The three-day course will see the Minister of Sports, Sunday Dare and Permanent Secretary of the Ministry, Ismaila Abubakar gracing the occasion.
