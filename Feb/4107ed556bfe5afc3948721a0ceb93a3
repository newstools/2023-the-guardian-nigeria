Why not? Present and past Nigerians have wondered about the reasons that necessitate citizens to vote; Is it a right that empowers or a right to be ignored? Given the history, perhaps such pessimism stems from a lack of trust from a consistently failed democratic system. A democratic nation is generally viewed positively around the world, as it is seen as a system of government that allows for the participation and representation of the people within a society. In an ideal democratic nation, individuals are able to exercise their fundamental rights and freedoms, including the right to vote and the freedom of speech, association, and assembly. The principles of democracy are often seen as essential to protecting human rights, promoting social justice, and ensuring good governance. As for Nigeria, the country has had a complicated relationship with democracy over the years as the textbook definition of democracy is different from the Nigerian reality, leaving citizens numb to the point of questioning their fundamental human rights when it comes to casting their vote. As the international community seat back to observe the outcome of the 2023 General elections, Time has accurately described the 2023 general election as “A key test of democracy in 2023.” While deciding whether to vote or not, Nigerian often neglect the hidden truth–that some renowned and unrecognised Nigerian in the past had fought for the independent right to vote in the country. How this knowledge regarding past efforts to institutionalize voting affects the present decisions to vote still remains up in the air. Heroes Of Democratic Rule In Nigeria
Nigeria has a rich history of political struggle and activism in a bid to take back their mandate, with many individuals and groups playing significant roles in the fight for democracy from colonial rule. The likes of Herbert Macaulay have gone down in history as the father of Nigerian nationalism and was a prominent figure in the struggle for independence from colonial rule. He founded the Nigerian National Democratic Party in 1923, which became a major political force in the country. Nnamdi Azikiwe: He was one of the most prominent Nigerian nationalists and a key figure in the struggle for independence and founder of the West African Pilot newspaper in 1937, which became a powerful tool for political activism and mobilization. Obafemi Awolowo: was a leading figure in the struggle for independence and the first Premier of the Western Region of Nigeria. Awolowo was a strong advocate for federalism and played a key role in the drafting of Nigeria’s first constitution. Tafawa Balewa: Another leading figure in the struggle for independence. Balewa was a key negotiator with the British government and played a crucial role in the formation of Nigeria as a republic. Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti: She was a ‘feminist’ and human rights activist who fought for the independence of Nigeria from colonial rule. Ransome-Kuti was a leader of the Women’s International Democratic Federation and was the first woman to drive a car in Nigeria. Aminu Kano: He was a socialist and political activist who fought for the rights of ordinary Nigerians. Kano was a founding member of the Northern Elements Progressive Union and played a key role in the struggle for independence. Freedom From Colonial Rule And Lack Of Trust In self Rule
After all of the sweat blood of our heroes’ past, Nigeria gained independence from British colonial rule in 1960, but the country was soon plunged into a series of military coups and counter-coups, with military rulers dominating the political landscape for much of the country’s history. In 1999, Nigeria returned to civilian rule after nearly 16 years of military dictatorship, and the country has held several democratic elections since then. However, Nigeria’s democracy has been marred by issues such as corruption, electoral fraud, and political violence, which have undermined public confidence in the system. Since the Endsars saga of October 3, 2020 there has been a growing youth movement in Nigeria that is pushing for greater political participation and engagement. In the wave of that, sensitization on the need to vote has filtered that fabric of the nation. Despite these challenges, there are many Nigerians who are committed to democratic principles and who are working to strengthen the country’s democratic institutions. Nigeria has a vibrant civil society, with many active NGOs, media organizations, and human rights groups that are advocating for democratic reforms and holding the government accountable. Overall, while Nigeria’s democracy is far from perfect, there is a strong desire among many Nigerians to build a more democratic and equitable society.
The feelings of Nigerian citizens towards voting and the efficacy of their votes vary depending on several factors such as their political awareness, experiences with past elections, and level of trust in the political system. However, it is generally agreed that the history of inconsistent democratic rule in Nigeria has eroded the trust of many citizens in the electoral process, making them cynical about the impact of their votes. PVC Collection
Many Nigerians believe that the electoral process is marred by irregularities, including vote-buying, ballot box snatching, and manipulation of election results. These irregularities often lead to disputed election outcomes, resulting in post-election violence, protests, and court cases. Consequently, some citizens feel discouraged from participating in the electoral process, believing that their votes would not count or that their preferred candidate would not emerge as the winner, regardless of the votes cast. On the other hand, some Nigerians still believe in the power of their votes to effect change, and they continue to participate actively in the electoral process, despite the challenges. Premium Times reported on the 23rd of February that Nigeria’s electoral commission, INEC, recorded a 93.3 percent Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) collection rate ahead of Saturday’s Presidential and National Assembly elections. Again in recognition of their social duties, Multichoice partnered with INEC to bring awareness about the collection of PVC’S On the official twitter handle of INEC the electoral body gave a summation of registered voters which reads”summary of the Registered Voters ahead of the #NigeriaDecides2023 election; ✓ Number of Collected PVCs = 87,209,007 ✓ Number of Uncollected PVCs = 6,259,229 collected.” Stating that, 93,3% of the 93,469,008 registered voters had collected their PVCs. There have also been instances where votes have made a significant difference in the outcome of elections, giving hope to citizens who believe that their votes count and that their participation is essential for the development of the country. The rate of PVC collection peaked in comparison to the 86.3 per cent recorded in 2019 and 81.2 per cent in 2015. More Hardship
As the 2023 elections draw closer, the hardship of many Nigerian citizens deepens, one thing it seems to be consistent in. From fuel hike to Naira scarcity, the mental stability and endurance of Nigerians continues to be stretched as everyone walks around with a brewing anger resulting from all existing in the realms of the country. Since the announcement of the new naira note, Nigerians have tossed and turned in a power tussle by the Federal government and CBN. The World Bank Country Office in Abuja, the capital of Nigeria, warned that tensions in the country could rise as a result of the hardships fuel shortages and the naira redesign policy are causing for Nigerians. The deadline of February 10th for the phasing-out of old naira notes has skyrocketed in a cash shortage making Nigerian most citizens economically and socially incapacitated. Overall, the feelings of Nigerian citizens towards voting and the efficacy of their votes are mixed, with some feeling discouraged and cynical, while others remain optimistic and committed to the democratic process.
