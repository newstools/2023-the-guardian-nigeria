Yiaga board chairman, Dr Hussaini Abdu who stated this, Thursday in Abuja while presenting the groups preliminary statement on the conduct of the presidential election process, regretted that the economic hardship may Impact on citizens’ participation barely 48 hours to the Presidential elections. Abdu maintained that the untold economic hardship caused by the recent scarcity of new naira notes and perennial fuel scarcity has led to a series of protests in different parts of the country. “This growing discontent amongst citizens may lead to voter apathy in the form of “protest” which will eventually lead to low voter turnouts. We are also worried that citizens facing these forms of adversities going into the election may be unable to make informed choices at the polls. “The current Naira redesign policy and scarcity of legal tender are aimed to fight vote trading on election day, the prevailing hardship it has come with may even make it easier for voters to relinquish their votes in exchange for the scarce currency.” He said. Acknowledging the existing security challenges of insurgency, banditry and kidnapping, Abdu said the prevailing security situation leading to the 2023 Presidential election has been further escalated by the tense political atmosphere. He commended the political parties and candidates for signing the National Peace Accord and initiative of the National Peace Committee, headed by the former Head of State, General Abdulsalami Abubakar and called on the parties, candidates and their supporters to maintain the peace during and after the elections.
