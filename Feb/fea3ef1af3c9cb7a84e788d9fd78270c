The Labour Party’s presidential candidate was portrayed by Yul Edochie who attempted to mimic the voice, attire, and demeanor of the presidential contender, as can be seen in the teaser. Many people have discussed his participation in this film since the trailer’s release. While many people have praised the effort to relay Obi’s narrative, others have criticized the movie’s appearance and, more crucially, the actor’s attempt to sound like him. One comment read, “Nice one. But the voice wasn’t necessary.. You can pass your message without mimicking.. BTW, that’s not even Peter Obi’s voice! He has a nice and meek voice. This looks like mockery to me.”
