All Progressives Congress (APC) senatorial candidate for Lagos West, Dr. Idiat Adebule, has expressed her desire to provide excellent legislative interventions to his constituency. During a stakeholders’ meeting in Ikeja as part of her campaign tour to various local councils, yesterday, she promised to give her constituents a worthy representation with integrity. At the event, the Awise of Onigbongbo, Oba Oluwasegun Adeniyi, and a member of Governor’s Advisory Council (GAC), Dr. Abayomi Finnih, urged Ikeja residents to vote massively for Adebule. They also canvassed votes for APC presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu; as well as re-election of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, James Faleke and other candidates. Oba Adeniyi: “We are happy to be here today. This is our project. We are in this together. APC has done well for the state. Let us vote for all APC candidates. All of you in Ikeja constituency should vote en masse for them,” he said. Finnih, who is the Baasegun of Lagos, described Adebule as a cerebral person and loyal party member. He said: “We brought Adebule to our area to celebrate her because we believe that her election is a done deal. I have a lot of respect for you (Adebule). This is borne out of our relationship at GAC Meetings. You always stand by the party whenever there’s crisis. You stood by the party during trouble period. You’re not just a learned personality, you also exhibited respect.”
