As with more passport desk offices being opened across states in the federation, Comptroller General of the Nigeria Immigration Service, (NIS), Isah Idris, has assured Nigerians that challenges being faced in passport processing at home and in the diaspora, will soon give way for the emergence of seamless passport application and processing. He said the agency is not unaware of challenges being experienced by applicants in accessing passport services in recent times but the various efforts emplaced in recent times will address the issues as more passport front offices are being opened. The CG made this known at the commissioning of the Katsina state NIS command and the unveiling of an enhanced electronic passport, (e-passport), facility in the state, yesterday. He said “Efforts are ongoing to ensure more front offices are opened in the state to reduce the traffic. Soon, the office in Daura will be due for commissioning. The equipment for the enhanced e-passport has already been set up in Katsina. In a few days’ time, it will become operational, hopefully alongside the Daura front office” According to him, “With the rollout of this enhanced travel document, it is certain that cases of delays in processing Passports will be taken care of, provided applicants abide strictly with the application guidelines, including ensuring that they make use of the online application and payment platform as well as to synchronize the data in their passport application with the information in their NIN (National Identification Number).
