Alongside her performance, she revealed an unexpected guest made visible with her baby bump. The shocking news of her expecting baby number two has erupted social media and the internet. The Stay singer was asked if there would be any surprises during her concert at Arizona’s State Farm Stadium in an interview last week. Responding to that she said, “I’m thinking about bringing someone,” she replied. “I’m not sure, we’ll see.” This left fans to naturally conclude thinking that she was referring to one of the several musicians she has worked with throughout her successful career knowing the tradition of the half-time show of unexpected duets that Jay-Z, Drake, or Eminem would make a guest appearance. With her performance, fans understood Rihanna was not referring to any of them. She was actually dropping hints that she was expecting her second child at the time, but nobody noticed. Although the singer didn’t perform any brand-new music during her appearance at the Super Bowl on Sunday, the baby bump she showed off sparked waves on the internet. As a throng of enthusiastic dancers in all white gathered below, Rihanna made an appearance on one of the numerous floating platforms that protruded above the audience. Better Have My Money was the singer’s first song, which was an amusing introduction given that she wasn’t being paid for her appearance at the Super Bowl. The crowd erupted in applause. The dancers beneath the 34-year-old while she charmed the audience from above displayed razor-sharp choreography that they would carry throughout the entire performance. In front-loading her set with some of her most danceable and up-tempo songs, such as Only Girl (In The World) and the excellent Where Have You Been, the singer blasted through a number of well-known hits. Even after she had been brought to the earth, the half-time performance was not lacking in spectacle. She started singing the uplifting We Found Love as fireworks were set off above the stadium. It was a wise choice to stick to her huge back catalogue, one of the best in pop, despite rumors that the artist may use the occasion to perform new music not materializing. The performer performed only the first verse or chorus of certain songs while jamming a ton of hits into a brief 14-minute set. But massive singles like Rude Boy were countered with the less well-known and slightly harder-edged Pour It Up. The set list utilized some of her most well-known collaborations, which was somewhat disappointing because none of her collaborators actually joined her on stage. There were no cameos by Jay-Z, Ye (previously Kanye West), or DJ Khaled, who often appear on Run This Town, All of the Lights, and Wild Thoughts during her performances of those songs. However, their absence had no impact. By this time, everyone’s focus was firmly fixed on a completely new and highly noticeable special visitor.
