The governorship aspiration of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) candidate in Enugu State, Frank Nweke Jr, received a boost, at the weekend, as his home community of Ozalla, in Enugu South Council, hosted him to a reception, where they donated branded Toyota Sienna van, among other items, in support of his campaign. At the event, held at St. Paulâ€™s Primary School field, thousands of Ozalla residents, who also showed their support with dancing, singing and masquerade performances, including presentation of Ofo by Agadi Iyiagboku, urged Nweke to remain true to his promises to the state. Chairman of the community, Cyril Aninwike, said the crowd was an evidence of the honour accorded to Nweke in his hometown.
