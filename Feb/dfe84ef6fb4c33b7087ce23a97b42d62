The All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate Bola Tinubu has won in the polling unit of former President Olusegun Obasanjo, who endorsed Peter Obi, the Labour Party candidate for the election. At Unit 2, Ward 11, Olushomi compound, Totoro – Sokori area of Abeokuta North LG of Ogun State, Tinubu polled  56, while Obi followed with nine votes and Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) secured seven votes. Out of the 693 registered voters, only 91 were accredited. After Obasanjo endorsed Obi last month, the APC Presidential Campaign Council spokesman, Mr Bayo Onanuga, said nobody in Ogun could rely on Obasanjo to become governor or councillor. In a statement, Onanuga said: “From our records, President Obasanjo has not successfully made anyone win an election in Nigeria since then. “Not even in Ogun State can anyone rely on his support or endorsement to become a governor or councillor. “We pity Peter Obi as we are confident that Chief Obasanjo cannot win his polling unit and ward in Abeokuta for Obi in the coming Presidential election on 25 February 2023.”
