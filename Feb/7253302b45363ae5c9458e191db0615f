The Bauchi State Government has assured workers that their December salary payment will reflect the N30, 000 minimum wage. The national minimum wage, which was signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari, on April 18 2019, has only been implemented for workers in level seven and below. Governor Bala Mohammed had, on November 30, 2022, approved payment of N30, 000 minimum wage to workers in the state. The governor said that the implementation of the consequential adjustment on minimum wage was for officers on grade level seven and above in both state and council levels, with effect from December 1, 2022. MEANWHILE, the state chapter of the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC) has applauded the state government for implementing the national minimum wage for civil servants. The state NLC Chairman, Danjuma Saleh, thanked the state government for the move, adding that it would help boost the economy of state workers. He assured that workers in the state would give their support to the current administration as long as it continues to treat them well. “Many people had been doubtful it government is serious; but right from yesterday, we have been sitting over the template of implementation. “We have come to agree on a certain point between us and the government. We have concluded and signed the agreement. Indeed, I’m happy being a leader, and we appreciate whatever brings positive impact to lives of our people. We expect that more will be done to make our workers happier,” he said.
