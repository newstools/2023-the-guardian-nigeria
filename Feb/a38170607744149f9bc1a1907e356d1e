The interim government campaigner and former presidential candidate, Reverend Chris Okotie, has reminded Nigerians ahead of the forthcoming general elections that his restructuring proposition, which he has christened, The Okotie Option (TOKO) remains the best option for the country, moving forward. A statement made available by his media adviser, Ladi Ayodeji said Okotie decided to name his change mantra TOKO to give it a strong sound bite. He added that regardless of the outcome of the forthcoming elections, his principal remains committed to his beliefs that only a properly restructured Nigeria under the auspices of an interim government could create the enabling environment for anyone seeking elective office to successfully implement their manifestoes. Okotie said: “The present system of governance has become inimical and subversive to the Nigerian cause. Only an interim government with a philosophy of aboriginal democracy can salvage Nigeria from the cusp of an imminent catastrophic disintegration. It’s time for TOKO!” The cleric dismissed insinuations in certain quarters that his call for an interim government is inappropriate in an election year, saying previous transition programmes never produced a settled polity because of the contradictions of the current constitution. Arguing that the on-going election cycle would not produce the much-anticipated change in the fortunes of Nigerians because of the inherent defects of the 1999 Constitution being operated, Okotie maintained that only an interim government charged with the responsibility of bringing about Aboriginal Democracy is capable of giving the country a legitimate framework for an all inclusive, indigenous constitution that would be acceptable to Nigerians.
