The group made the call on Saturday at a news conference where they also demanded for the redeployment of the Deputy Commissioner Of Police in charge of operations in the state. Spokesperson for the groups, Dr Claimnz Enamhe, stated that facts on ground showed the DCP Operations had no respect for the Oath of Office he swore to. The groups recalled the role played by the DCP during the Ogoja/Yala bye-election and posited that with him, there was no way the security agency would be neutral.

“We call on President Buhari, who is the number one security officer of the country, to look at the case of Cross River State and ask the Inspector General of Police to, without any delay, redeploy DCP Francis Idu, “We have very serious information that some people are sponsoring some security personnel to harrass and intimidate voters by all means. Enamhe, who is the National President of the Advancement of Cross River State People (NAACP), noted that the 2023 general elections were for the people to decide who to entrust with governance of the state.

He appealed to men and officers of the police command and other security agencies not to allow themselves to be used to haras and disenfranchise voters, especially supporters of the opposition parties. However, spokesperson of the state Police Command, SP Irene Ugbo, said the Command had remained resolute and most professional in the discharge of its constitutional duty of protection of lives and property. She urged all parties involved to remain calm and law abiding as there was no cause for alarm. “We are not police for any political party, we are police for the entire citizenry, our duty is to protect lives and property, and we won’t violate that to please anybody,” she stated
