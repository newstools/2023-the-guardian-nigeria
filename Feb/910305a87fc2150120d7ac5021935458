Forum of Lagos State Baales has endorsed the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu. It also backed the re-election of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos. The forum did the endorsement during its first executive meeting held at Eti-Osa Local Council to reinforce the need for a credible election and to reinstate the roles of traditional leaders in ensuring a stable and peaceful society. According to the forum’s chairman, Chief Joseph Keshinro, current events and activities of mischief-makers have further challenged the Baales not to keep quiet while some elements plan to destroy the country. While calling on the Baales to ensure that Tinubu and Sanwo-Olu emerged victorious in the coming elections, Keshinro said: “It is strange the type of criticisms trailing the aspiration of Tinubu.”
