The new General Officer Commanding (GOC), 82 Division, Nigerian Army, Enugu, Major General Aminu Chinade, said, yesterday, that the army would remain neutral and professional in ensuring peaceful conduct of the 2023 general elections. He stated this while taking over leadership as the 37th GOC of the division. He noted that the army would ensure fairness and equity to all political parties and their candidates, as well as protect the sanctity of the electoral process. He, therefore, charged officers and soldiers to live above board and brace up to the task of ensuring a smooth transition for sustained peace and development of the country.
He added: “The security situation of the division is challenging, but it is my belief that we shall overcome it working together. This will start with the process of the coming elections. We will also partner other security agencies to achieve our core mandate.” Chinade appreciated the immediate past GOC of the division, Major General Umar Musa, and other commanders for their dedication to service, even as he thanked the Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Faruk Yahaya, for the confidence reposed in him to serve in the division. Earlier, the outgoing GOC, Gen. Musa, had urged officers of the division to extend cooperation to the new GOC to enable him succeed.
