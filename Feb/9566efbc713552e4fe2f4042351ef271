Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, has justified his failure to hold a campaign rally in Rivers State. He said he took the decision to avoid loss of life and destruction of property in the state. Atiku, who stated this when he met with Rivers State stakeholders in Abuja, late Sunday, said his campaign and the PDP fully subscribe to the position that no political ambition is worth the blood of any Nigerian. Rivers has been plagued by election-related violence, which has seen top PDP leaders in the state attacked, including a former Minister of Transportation, Abiye Sekibo, and Senator Lee Maeba. Opposition leaders in the state, including Social Democratic Party’s governorship candidate, Magnus Abe, and his Accord Party counterpart, Dumo-Lulu Briggs, have also been attacked. Atiku said: “Although, we did not wish for this, it became expedient that we think and act innovatively to protect the lives of our people from the mindless violence and bloodshed instigated by the very persons who have the primary responsibility for their security and wellbeing. “Clearly, events on the ground in Rivers State and this gathering, here, at the insistence of our Rivers PDP family, confirm the historic relationship between me and Rivers state. “Beyond being a good corporate citizen of Rivers State, I have deeply connected with several families in the state over the years, a relationship that has endured for decades, long before politics. That is why I remain confident of the support of Rivers people for PDP and our presidency.” Atiku urged the stakeholders “to keep the faith, even in the face of harassment and needless violent intimidation, and turn out massively on Saturday and cast your votes, as usual, for PDP.” He added: “I assure you that your sacrifice and support will be fully rewarded.”
