The kidnappers of the NTA reporter, Abdulwahab Babankanti and his three friends have released them unhurt. It was gathered that the four victims were freed on Wednesday, February 1, 2023, after the family met the demands of the abductors. Suspected gunmen abducted the victims along the highway while on transit from Bauchi to Jos.  Family sources said the men were picked up in Toro community of Bauchi State. According to a family source who pleaded anonymity: “We got to know of their abduction when the kidnappers called to confirm that they kidnapped them and that they were in their custody hale and hearty.” The source disclosed that the kidnappers had demanded N10m ransom. The source further said: ”As if the abductors were feeling the financial hardship that Nigerians are going through with ongoing currency squeeze, they called again on Wednesday asking the family to forget the N10m but should look for a substantial amount because they know that things are hard.” After meeting the undisclosed substantial amount by the family, the abductors released their victims at a place where they could find their way home.
