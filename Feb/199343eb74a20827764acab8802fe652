Gunmen have kidnapped the new Commissioner for Women Affairs, Cross River State, Prof. Getrude Njar. An eyewitness told The Guardian she was whisked away through the creeks around Mbukpa in Calabar South Council about 9.30 a.m., yesterday. It was also gathered that security officials that visited the scene found her car. Confirming the incident, the Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Eric Anderson, said her car was found at Mayne Avenue. He, however, said security operatives were on top of the matter. “Just this morning, we received report of the kidnap of our colleague, Prof. Getrude Njar, who is Commissioner for Women Affairs. The police have been contacted. She was kidnapped at Mayne Avenue this morning and her car has been retrieved. And the report is that they are closing up on them,” Anderson disclosed. At the time of filing this report, the state Police Public Relations Officer, Irene Ugbo, could not be reached to confirm the incident.
