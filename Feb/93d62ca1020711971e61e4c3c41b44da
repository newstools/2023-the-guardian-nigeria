Boxing promoter Eddie Hearn has revealed his interest in organizing a bout between former UFC heavyweight champion Francis Ngannou and Anthony Joshua. Ngannou recently became a free agent in the world of combat sports after failing to renew his contract with the UFC and is expected to transition to boxing. The 36-year-old is already being linked to several big names in the boxing world, including WBC world heavyweight champion Tyson Fury, and Hearn is looking to secure a match with Joshua. During an appearance on The MMA Hour, Hearn spoke highly of Ngannou, praising the Cameroonian’s achievements and demeanour. Hearn expressed his admiration for Ngannou and his willingness to navigate the “rocky” world of boxing. He views Ngannou’s transition to boxing as an opportunity to earn the money he feels he deserves, but acknowledges the difficulty of taking on either Joshua or Fury in his boxing debut. Hearn believes the unknown factor in the fight between Ngannou and Joshua makes it one of the biggest fights that can be made in any sport. “I think he should fight Joshua. These guys have a mountain to climb in terms of the challenge of fighting an elite boxer, but to go through the process of having two or three fights — one fight you might look bad because you’re learning, so the value really is the unknown,” Hearn said. “What happens when two titans from the world of fight sports collide? The UFC heavyweight world champion Ngannou and the two-time world heavyweight boxing champion Joshua. The complete unknown. “The unknown of how good is Ngannou? We know he punches extremely hard, if he lands one on Joshua, is it the greatest upset of all time? Or will AJ completely steamroll him and you’ll see Ngannou get knocked out? That’s the attraction of that fight, the unknown. “So for me, if I’m representing Ngannou, I want to make sure that this next move, I maximize every dollar that’s out there.”
