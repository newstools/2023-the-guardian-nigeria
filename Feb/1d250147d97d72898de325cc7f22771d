It was a battle of giants at the NPA/GTCO Lagos International Polo Tournament at the weekend when reigning champions, Lagos Leighton Kings, faced a determined Kano Lintex-Intercontra in the final game of the prestigious Majekodunmi Cup. The game, witnessed by many polo enthusiasts at the revered Lagos Polo Club, Ikoyi, kept the spectators on their toes throughout the duration, but Lagos Leighton Kings eventually triumphed 10-6 to reclaim the event’s biggest prize they lost last year on sudden death goal to Kano Lintex-Intercontra. The victory was the team’s fourth major title to make them overall champions of the prestigious polo festival that enters its grand finale this week. There are other major trophies still on offer, including the Low Cup and Silver Cup, as well as three subsidiary prizes, which 26 teams are set to compete for. Before the weekend’s epic final, Lagos Leighton Kings had earlier won the Dapo Ojora Memorial Cup, the Open Cup and the Independence Cup, where they also beat their Kano-based opponents in a six-chukka cracker. Lintex-intercontra, boasting Baba Dantata, Genaro Ringer, Alejo Aramburu and their patron, Bashir Dantata, had started the final with a spark scoring two quick goals in the opening chukka, before the Kings level up in the second chukka and pulled away in the fifth chukka. Speaking on his team’s feat, Leighton Kings’ patron, Bowale Jolaoso said: “It is difficult to put it in words… it is like our first Majekodunmi Cup victory four years ago, and I want to thank our teeming supporters and my team mates for their commitment and fighting spirits.” Other winners of the loaded second weekend that had as Special Guest, Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, were Lagos Elektron-Aragon team that defeated Kaduna Dattaku 7-21/2 to clinch the Governor’s Cup and Golden Ranch that secured an extra chukka 6-4 victory over Iba Oil & Gas team to win the Lagos Heritage Cup.
