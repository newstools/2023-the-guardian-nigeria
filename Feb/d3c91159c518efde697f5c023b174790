It is a world of fairy godmothers with magic wands ready to give you a sparkly moment. Weiz Dhurm Franklyn brand has created high-end fashion in ready to wear making it look like a non-stop runway. Beverly, Chioma Ikokwu, amongst many other celebrities, have graced the red carpet and casual events alike strutting in Franklyn magic.
His style is a fine blend of Avant-garde and texture building. He is no stranger to the versatility of sheer and her wonders. The Weiz Dhurm Franklyn brand is predominantly a women’s fashion brand created by Wisdom Adaba. The label creates a blend of African heritage with a modern elegant twist. Each collection and design is carefully crafted to give the ultimate elegance experience to the Weiz Dhrum Franklyn Woman. The AMVC spotted Franklyn pieces on the red carpet from Sika Osei to Fola Francis and film director Ifan Ifeanyi Michael all bearing the trademark of Avant-garde, fabric manipulation and artistry at its finest.
His interpretation of male fashion also bears the trademark of the brand with experimental textures and embellishments that would traditionally be thought female. From ruffles to bloody roses, Franklyn sure knows how to keep a fashion conversation going. It is no wonder Burna boy rocked a Franklyn number at the “Lagos loves Damini concert’ in Lagos for the New Year 2023. While there was a rumble of etiquettes amongst Nigerian artists owing to the late start of the show, the glitter of his attire could not be dismissed. Featuring a glittery turtleneck and wide leg pants reminiscent of the 1970s style, Burna Boy laid out good vibes in a fashion fusion of sheer excellence. It is safe to say he made a Franklyn statement.
Wearing Franklyn is like wearing the brightest red an even.
