Bayelsa State Governor, Douye Diri, on Saturday night won the Sportsville Governor of the Year Award in recognition of the state’s performance in sports in the last three years of his administration. Diri was represented at the ceremony held at the Lagos Country Club in Ikeja-Lagos by the state’s Commissioner for Youth and Sports Development, Dr. Daniel Igali.
Speaking at the event, Diri dedicated the award to Bayelsa youths, particularly the sportsmen and women, for their hard work and commitment to bringing glory to the state. He expressed joy that his administration’s modest investment in sports was yielding good dividends, noting that the award was an encouragement to do more. Diri said the philosophy of his administration is to ensure that Bayelsa always win by fair means, adding: “Last weekend, also in Lagos, when I received The Sun Newspapers 2022 Governor of the Year Award, I dedicated it to the people of the state for their resilience in the face of last year’s monster flooding in our state. “Today, let me specifically acknowledge the hard work, dedication and commitment of the Bayelsa sports men and women. “I recognise their efforts in ensuring that they bring glory to the state at every competition they participate in, despite the challenges. “I therefore dedicate this honour and recognition to all our sportsmen and women as well as youths of our state striving to give Bayelsa a good image.
