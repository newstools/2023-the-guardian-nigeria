The Executive Board of the Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN) received a vote of confidence during its yearly general congress held in Abuja at the weekend. The Congress also adopted the newly amended constitution of the AFN based on the recommendation of the World Athletics. Among personalities at the Congress was president of Nigeria Olympic Committee (NOC), Habu Gumel, members from states across the Federation, who took time to acknowledge the leadership role of AFN President, Tonobok Okowa. Among other feats, the Okowa-led board returned Nigeria to the podium at the last Olympics Games in Tokyo, Japan, after 13 years, courtesy of a bronze medal won by Ese Brume in long jump. The board also led Nigeria’s U-20 team to win an unprecedented gold medal in Nairobi, Kenya, the best in the history of the championship. To complete a remarkable 2021, the Okowa-led board also saw Tobi Amusan become the first Nigerian in World Athletics’ Diamond era to win a Diamond League discipline. Last year, Brume returned Nigeria to the World Indoor Championships podium in Belgrade with her silver medal win. It came 14 years after Olusoji Fasuba last mounted the stage as World Indoor 60m champion. Okowa thanked the Congress for their support during and after his election as the President of Africa Athletics Region 2 (West Africa), promising that the board is eager and ready to take athletics to the next level this year. He informed the Congress of the now cordial relationship between the AFN leadership and the erstwhile president of the Federation, Ibrahim Gusau.
