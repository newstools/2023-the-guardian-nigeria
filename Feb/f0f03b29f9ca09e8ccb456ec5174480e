According to Plymouth police, officers were summoned to the city’s Mutley Plain neighborhood. Officers reported that a swan had been taken from Plymouth Harbour by a “drunk male” and had probably been hit by a car around two miles (3.2 kilometers) away. The bird was taken to the veterinarian by police, who said that concerned citizens had wrapped a blanket over it. Plymouth Police D Section tweeted of the incident, “Not your usual prisoner! “Report of a swan being removed from the harbour by a drunk male before it being involved in a collision on Mutley Plain. “Taken to the vets where they are nursing it back to health.” Devon and Cornwall Police said the man had left the area before officers arrived.
