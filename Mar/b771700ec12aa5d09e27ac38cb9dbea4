Residents of Owo, Ondo State have been thrown into confusion following the death of a 29-year-old nursing mother, Tawa, and her five-month-old baby.
 
With the husband of the deceased nursing mother in critical condition at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the Federal Medical Centre (FMC), Owo, the tragic incident was suspected to have been caused by the fumes of the generator they bought less than a week ago.
 
The couple said to be members of staff of FMC had put on the generator before they went to bed.  A source at FMC said: “Tawa had called her elder sister on Thursday evening to say that her baby was sick, and the sister told her to bring the baby to the hospital. When the deceased’s sister got to FMC at about 1 pm, she was told that neither she nor the husband was at work.
 
“This made the situation worrisome with some co-workers of the deceased on a search mission to their house in the company of the elder sister. When they got there, they found the door locked and had to forcefully break in, but shocked by what they saw.”
  
They saw the couple lying unconscious on the bed, while the baby had already passed out.
  
In an effort to resuscitate the couple after rushing them to FMC, Tawa was placed on a ventilator but later gave up, with medical personnel still battling to save the husband.
