Former Imo State deputy governor Gerald Irona has been remanded in prison by a Magistratesâ€™ court sitting in Owerri. The Imo State Police Command arraigned Irona on three counts bordering on treason, illegal possession of state government property and for making utterances capable of causing public disturbance. The Magistrate, Chike Ezerioha ordered that Irona be remanded in prison pending when the issue of bail is heard and determined by the state high court in Owerri. Earlier, the defense counsel had argued that Irona should be granted bail based on self recognition. But the lead prosecutor, said the magistrate lacked the jurisdiction to hear the matter since one of the charges against Irona bordered on felony. However, the Magistrate agreed with the prosecution counsel that she lacked the jurisdiction to entertain the matter or grant the accused bail, explaining that it is only the high court that can entertain such matter and rule on bail application. She said the prosecution counsel should make all documents available to the defence counsel to enable them take next legal line of action. Also, she ordered that the case file be transferred to the state Department of Public Prosecutions. A defense counsel and legal adviser of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Kissinger Ikeokwu, expressed confidence that Irona would be granted bail at the high court.
