   In a statement signed by its President, Secretary and Legal Adviser, Prof. Wole Smith (SAN), Dr. Mobolaji Akerele (FWACP) and Lawal Pedro (SAN), the group noted that Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu had performed well in developing the state, and should be supported for a second term. The statement reads: “The forthcoming Gubernatorial and House of Assembly elections in the state are the focus of Eko Foundation at the moment, and we urge the good people of Lagos State to vote for the All Progressive Congress (APC). Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu deserves a second term for his striking and enviable achievements in the administration and development of the state. “Sanwo-Olu’s administration is an inclusive one and over the years, APC has been magnanimous towards all tribes within the state. It is safer to go with the benevolent APC with a convincing pedigree rather than risk the unknown. We urge the good people of Lagos State to vote for progress, continuity, consolidation and sustainability.” The foundation also condemned the “recent provocative statements by a particular tribe to foment trouble in the state,” noting that “their claim to Lagos State is self-deceit and illusion.” It continued: “We observe with dismay, the unguarded and provocative utterances of members of a particular tribe in Lagos State, who are bent on destabilising the equilibrium and peace in the state, as well as to threaten free and fair elections on March 11, 2023.” “We condemn their threat of violence in very strong terms and regard their malicious claim to Lagos State as self-deceit and illusion. Every ethnic group in Lagos State has been accommodated and given unfettered access to the resources of the state notwithstanding non-reciprocity on the part of the said belligerent members of the said tribe in their home-state.”
