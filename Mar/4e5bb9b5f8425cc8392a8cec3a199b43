Sustained buying interest ahead of more scorecards continued last week, as the Nigerian capital market extended its gains for the third consecutive week. The increase in stocks pushed the all-share index and market capitalisation up by 0.5 per cent and N145 billion to close at 55,794.51 points and N30.395 trillion respectively. All other indices finished higher except NGX Main Board, NGX CG, NGX Banking, NGX Pension, NGX AFR Bank Value, NGX AFR Div. Yield, NGX MERI Growth, NGX MERI Value, NGX Consumer Goods and NGX Oil and Gas indices, which depreciated by 0.09.per cent, 0.74 per cent, 1.82 per cent, 0.57 per cent, 2.04 per cent, 0.57 per cent, 0.88 per cent, 1.91.per cent, 0.26 per cent and 3.82 per cent respectively. The NGX ASeM index closed flat. The sustained bullish trend was spurred mainly by buying interests in Dangote Cement (+3.6 per cent), MTNN (+1.3 per cent), and UBN (+2.3 per cent) despite uncertainties in the country’s political space. Analysts linked the performance to investors’ bargain hunters and positioning in anticipation of improved full-year earnings and dividend declarations. Cordros Capital said: “We expect market performance to be dominated by the bulls in the week ahead, as we expect investors to take positions in stocks with attractive dividend yields. “However, we envisage an undulating pattern will emerge as intermittent profit-taking activities will likely persist. “Overall, we advise investors to seek trading opportunities in only fundamentally justified stocks as the weak macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.” Afrinvest said: “Despite the downbeat investor sentiment, we expect the market to trend upwards as investors continue to react to corporate earnings results.” Chief Research Officer of Investdata Consulting, Ambrose Omodion, said: “We expect mixed sentiments and correction, just as investors’ position for dividend declared in expectation of more financials. “Market players should target dividend-paying companies and defensive stocks to protect their portfolios ahead of the governorship election and post-dividend adjustment. “As such, investors should take advantage of price correction. Also looking at the trends and events across the globe and domestically.” Further breakdown of last week’s transactions showed that a turnover of one billion shares worth N20 billion was recorded in 18,650 deals by investors on the floor of the exchange, in contrast to a total of 1.9 billion shares valued at N18.4 billion that changed hands in 20,311 deals during the preceding week.
