Virtually all the blue-chip stocks depreciated in price at the close of transactions, yesterday, on the floor of  the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) as profit taking dragged market capitalisation by N1 billion.

Similarly, the overall market capitalisation value lost N1 billion to close at N30.290 trillion. The market’s negative performance was driven by price depreciation in large and medium capitalised stocks, which are: MRS Oil Nigeria, Multiverse Mining and Exploration, Zenith Bank, NCR Nigeria and FBN Holdings (FBNH). Analysts at Afrinvest Limited said, “in the next trading session, we expect mild gains in the market as investors hunt for bargains.” For Vetiva Dealings and Brokerage: “with investors still awaiting full year results from the Tier-I banks, these stocks remain under pressure, as profit taking activity continues.
