The Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) is working with other stakeholders to mitigate the slight tightness being experienced in the distribution of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS). Mr Farouk Ahmed, Authority Chief Executive, NMDPRA made this known in a statement on Sunday.
He said that operations in loading depots have fully resumed, following the restriction of movements during the recently concluded Presidential and National Assembly elections, which necessitated truck drivers to travel to exercise their civic duty. The chief executive said the public should take note that the current stock sufficiency stood at 35.39 days for PMS, 34.86 days for Automotive Gas Oil (AGO) and 31.36 days for Aviation Turbine Kerosene (ATK). “The authority continues to strive towards guaranteeing supply and distribution reliability nationwide and strongly advises against panic buying,” the ACE said.
