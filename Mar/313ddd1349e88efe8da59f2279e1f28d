The Governor of Abia State, Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu, has said losing the senatorial election to Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe in last Saturday’s National Assembly election was not an issue that worries him. Ikpeazu, who said he is thankful to God for the opportunity to serve the state as governor for eight years, told journalists that he was grateful to God that no life was lost in the election, as he was not ready to engage in violence or spill blood to win an election. Ikpeazu said in any democratic setting, it is expected that you win some battles and lose some.
 
Ikpeazu said: “It is service, and if the opportunity fails to come to you, you thank God for the ones you won.  I cannot spill blood for politics. I am a happy man and now focused on March 11 governorship election.” He acknowledged that the Peter Obi candidacy affected most of the results from the South East, noting it was important to focus on the governorship election coming up in about 10 days.
