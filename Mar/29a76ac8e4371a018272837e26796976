The Nigeria Union of Teachers (NUT) and members of the National Association of Proprietors of Private Schools (NAPPS) in Ogun State have jointly thrown their weight behind the re-election bid of Governor Dapo Abiodun. The state Chairman of NUT, Akinola Abiodun, who gave the endorsement at an interactive session with the governor in Abeokuta, noted with delight the efforts of the government in repositioning the education sector for greater performance. “Your government has taken education to greater heights. We are non-partisan, but we are 100 per cent behind you as our employer. We will support and work for your return,” he said. The NUT chairman, however, called for recruitment of more teachers to replace those that have retired, restoration of teachers’ peculiar allowance and payment of leave bonus arrears. Also speaking, President of NAPPS, Ogun State chapter, Mr. Adekunle Osibemiwo, called for harmonisation of taxes paid by school proprietors, as well as appointment of a person with disability to head the Special Education Department in the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, pledging to support the governor’s re-election bid. Responding, Abiodun said his administration had renovated more than 100 public schools, built 1,500 affordable housing units, constructed over 400 kilometres of road, while the construction of the Agro-cargo Airport at Illisan is ongoing with the landing of aircraft. He described teachers as pathfinders who nurture and bring up morally upright children for the society, lauding them for contributing to the peace in the state by inculcating the right values in their pupils. The governor, who noted that plans had been concluded to commence the Digital Lesson Plan in schools while running costs for schools would be released without further delay, announced the release of brand new cars for the newly-appointed Head-Teacher-Generals in the state.
