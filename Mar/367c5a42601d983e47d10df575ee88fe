 FIFA (www.FIFA.com) and the Local Organising Committee (LOC) are pleased to announce that the media accreditation process for media representatives wishing to cover the Draw for the FIFA U-20 World Cup Indonesia 2023™ is now open. The draw will take place at the Ksirarnawa Art Center in Bali on Friday, 31 March 2023 at 19:00 local time.  The deadline for applications is 16 March 2023. Please note that the media accreditation process involves two steps: All applications are subject to confirmation, which will NOT be on a first come, first served basis. Successful applicants will be notified and provided with further information in due course. Furthermore, please be advised that international applicants are responsible for obtaining their own visas. Media accreditation via the FIFA Media Hub is for written press, photographers and media working for non-rights-holding broadcasters. There is a separate accreditation process for rights holding radio and television broadcasters that is organised by the FIFA Broadcaster Servicing Team. Please contact BroadcasterServicing@fifa.org for information. Details on the media activities planned around the Draw will follow.
