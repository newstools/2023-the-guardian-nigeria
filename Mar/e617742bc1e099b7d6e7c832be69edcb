A compelling tale of love and danger, the movie received the prestigious AMAA award for Best Film by an African-born director living abroad in September 2022, and had its world premiere screening at the Smithsonian National Museum of African Art in Washington DC, as part of its debut presentation of the +234 Connect Film Festival. It has also received the ReFrame Stamp, an initiative by the Sundance Institute, Women In Film, and IMDBpro, marking its success in UKgender-balance and the promotion of female-identifying people in film and TV productions. Oshin described the movie as a mind-boggling tale, visually and plot wise. “It is a mind-boggling tale that starts rocky, develops into a steady-romantic-family-oriented story, and then quickly becomes a dark edgy dangerous thriller. After all, they say, life itself is not always what it seems.”
