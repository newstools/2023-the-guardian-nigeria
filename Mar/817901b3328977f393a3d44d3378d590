Following gains recorded by many highly capitalised stocks, especially Dangote Cement and MTN Nigeria, transactions on the equities sector of the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) reversed negative sentiments, as market capitalisation advanced by N108 billion. At the close of trading yesterday, the All Share Index (ASI) rose by 197.20 absolute points, representing a gain of 0.35 per cent to close at 55,801.14 points. Also, investors gained N108 billion in value as market capitalisation went up to N30.398 trillion. The upturn was impacted by gains recorded in medium and large capitalised stocks, among which are, Dangote Cement, Nigerian Exchange Group, MTN Nigeria Communications (MTNN), Guaranty Trust Holding Company (GTCO) and Custodian Investment. Analysts at United Capital Plc predicted that the overall bullish sentiments in the equities market would linger. “This is hinged on the view that investors’ bullish sentiments will prevail amid post-election uncertainties and a depressed interest rate environment, particularly at the short end of the curve. “We foresee opportunities for BUY-SIDE investors to increase holdings (in the near term) on fundamentally sound stocks with improved valuation and dividend yield.” Of Vetiva Dealings and Brokerage it is believed that: “In the absence of large volume trades, we expect the market to revert to prior level, as investors continue to cherry-pick attractive counters across board.” As measured by market breadth, market sentiment was mixed, as 18 stocks appreciated in price while 18 constituted the losers chart.
