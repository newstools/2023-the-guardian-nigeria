The former governor of Enugu State, Sullivan Chime, has endorsed Dr Peter Mbah  the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the March 11 Governorship and State Assembly  elections. The former governor made his stand known in his Enugu residence during an interactive session between Mbah and some group of politicians and members of the businessmen community  on Sunday in Enugu. “Mbah is the best candidate for Enugu State. I have had interactions not just with him (Mbah), but with other candidates. Looking at the field, Mbah is the best and credible candidate Enugu can offer now. “I have no reservations whatsoever in endorsing and supporting him. I believe, that he will not disappoint the people of Enugu,” he said. He described Mbah as a great asset  for the state especially considering his track records of achievements in business and other public engagements saying recently his privately owned company has recorded over N1.4 trillion annual turnover. “When I was working with Sen. Chimaroke Nnamani, Mbah wasn’t a politician. Mbah is still not a politician. From our interactions he is very clear on what he wants to do. He has a passion of  giving  back to the state and  he has the passion of  taking  Enugu beyond what it is,” he added. He declared that Mbah had never been charged for any offence by the Ecomomic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) or any security agency.
