Chairman of the Governing Board of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Mrs. Lauretta Onochie, has regretted the delay in paying contractors.
According to her, the Commission has set up a committee to streamline payment of all verifiable outstanding debts and appealed for patience. Onochie stated this in Port Harcourt, yesterday, during a courtesy visit by a delegation of NDDC Contractors’ Association at the Commission’s headquarters in Port Harcourt. She stated: “One of the first things we did as a Board when we assumed office was to look for means to address unpaid bills. Please, be patient with us. Give us a little more time to do our house cleaning. “You are our partners in the development process. As partners in the development of the Niger Delta region, we need your cooperation.” A statement by the NDDC Director, Corporate Affairs, Ibitoye Abosede, said Onochie commended the  leadership of the contractors association for fighting for their members. She said: “When I hear about the backlog of debts to contractors, I get disturbed. It is only fair that contractors, who have done their jobs, get paid for them. We have set up a committee to work out modalities for paying the contractors.” Speaking earlier, the Chairman, NDDC Contractors Association, Mr. Joe Adia, stated that members of the group were critical stakeholders in the development of Nigeria’s oil-rich region. He said: “We are happy that a new board has taken off. Before now, the contractors were having a rough time. We believe the coming of the new board will bring changes to the NDDC. We are ready and eager to partner with NDDC.”
