Okocha had assured Wike that the APC in the state would reciprocate his efforts towards ensuring Tinubu’s victory by voting his candidates in next Saturday’s election. But in a swift reaction yesterday, the State Campaign Council of Tinubu/Shettima Committee, described Okocha’s statement as a total rascality, a call made in bad faith and not for the interest of Rivers people. The group argued that the credit for Tinubu’s victory of in Rivers belongs to all who turned out to vote APC candidate including Sen. Magnus Abe. The APC Presidential Campaign Council (PCC), led by Augustine Nwokocha, said Okocha was on his own over the statement.

Nwokocha in a statement he signed with the secretary and media Director of the TSG/ICC, Ineye Jack and Wenenda Onukwuru, including 17 Local Government Area Coordinators, said Okocha call is rejected, urging the residents to come and vote out Wike’s dictatorship. He noted that Rivers people do not deserve what they go through under Wike’s administration, stressing the need for a change. “We state that the victory of our President-Elect was a natural cause of event given his phenomenal pedigree as an astute politician per excellence, administrator with an untenable track record of achievement, foresight and bold visions. He denied the claims by Okocha that Wike donated, at least, N2 billion to fund Asiwaju’s campaigns and elections in the state, insisted that he saw no shishi of such money, neither was he aware of such donations.
