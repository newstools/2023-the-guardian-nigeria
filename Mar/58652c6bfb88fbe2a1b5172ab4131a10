Nigeria’s first female senator, Franca Afegbua, is dead. The deceased family announced her death in a statement issued on Sunday. “The Afegbua family of Edo state has confirmed the demise of the first woman senator in Nigeria, Senator Franca Afegbua, whose sad event occurred this morning, Sunday, March 12, 2023,” the family. Afegbua was a native of Okpella, a town in Etsako-east LGA of old Bendel state (now split into Edo and Delta states). She was elected the senator representing Bendel-north in October 1983 under the National Party of Nigeria in Nigeria’s second republic. Her political journey was, however, cut short as the military coup of December 1983 toppled the civilian government less than three months after she assumed office.
