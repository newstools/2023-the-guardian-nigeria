This is an opportunity to cheer every woman out there and especially to give trophies to the women doing excellent work across industries, despite everything. We curated this thread of quotes to remind every woman that she is the piece that completes the puzzle. We hope you’re inspired. “Never apologize for being a powerful woman.”
– Unknown “We need women who are so strong they can be gentle, so educated they can be humble, so fierce they can be compassionate, so passionate they can be rational, and so disciplined they can be free.”
– Kavita Ramdas “Each time a woman stands up for herself, she stands up for all women.”
– Maya Angelou “And one day, she discovered that she was fierce and strong, and full of fire and that not even she could hold herself back because her passion burned brighter than her fears.”
– Mark Anthony “Doubt is a killer.” “You just have to know who you are and what you stand for.”
– Jennifer Lopez “She was powerful not because she wasn’t scared but because she went on so strongly, despite the fear.”
– Atticus “I raise up my voice—not so that I can shout, but so that those without a voice can be heard.” We cannot all succeed when half of us are held back.”
— Malala Yousafzai “There is no limit to what we, as women, can accomplish.”
— Michelle Obama
