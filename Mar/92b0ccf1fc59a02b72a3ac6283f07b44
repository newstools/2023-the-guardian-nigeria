Professionals for good governance and social justice, yesterday, alleged that the February 25 presidential election did not reflect the will of Nigerians and therefore the result cannot be accepted.

In a statement signed by the Convener of the group, Ben Chukwu, they called on the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC), Trades Union Congress (TUC), Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), the Nigeria Bar Association (NBA) and Nigeria Medical Association (NMA), among others to join the group to rectify the outcome of the election.
