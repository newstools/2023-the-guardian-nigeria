There are countless job sites to peruse, relatively distant people to contact, and cold mail pitches that will almost certainly be rejected. If you manage to make it through this process and get to the interview stage, you will be faced with the dilemma of what to wear. Many ladies tend to overthink things when it comes to selecting an outfit for a job interview. While they want to showcase the fashionista in them, they also fear that doing too much would ruin their chances of being employed. Now, there is no perfect way to dress for a job interview, which is why we provide five basic tips on how to, dare we say, slay at a job interview. Comfort
Yes, we are big believers in the saying, “fashion is pain. However, for job interviews, comfort is key. This is primarily due to the tense nature of interviews, which causes anxiety in some ladies. So, rather than opt for a tight leather skirt, go with an A-line skirt. You can step up your look by wearing a chiffon blouse and stilettos. Less accessories
Sorry, but you might have to say good-bye to those punk rings or bead chains for a few hours. Unless it’s a creative agency where non-conformity is the watchword, toss those flashy jewels aside. The most jewellery you are allowed to wear is a pair of studs, a necklace, and one bracelet. Details matter… a lot
If you think you can manage to wear that skirt with a hole or a shoe whose sole is falling apart, well, chances are your village people are eagerly waiting for you. Pay close attention to details; these include, loose threads and wrinkles, among many others. Neutral knows best
When in doubt over whether those green pants match a blue blazer, ditch both of them and opt for black, white or grey. This gives your outfit an effortless look and feel while saving you embarrassment if you don’t get the colour combinations right. The type of job
While the above points are a good place to start, how you would show up at your prospective employer’s office is largely dependent on the job position you are going for, the nature of the organisation, and the dress code they have there. For example , you cannot show up for the role of a managing director dressed in a white shirt and black skirt paired with ballet shoes.
