He was given preliminary charges of rape and was charged on Friday, after the incident allegedly took place last Saturday. Preliminary charges under the French legal system means the judges have a reason to suspect a crime has been committed but are allowing time for further investigation to be conducted before finally deciding whether to send the case to trial. The player “strongly denied accusations made against him” said Fanny Colin, The footballer’s lawyer in a written message to The Associated Press. Colin said her client being indicted is an “obligatory step for any person being accused of rape and will allow Hakimi to defend himself by giving him access to the case. Colin also said that some elements collected by the judicial police show, according to her, that Hakimi “in this case has been subjected to a racketeering attempt.” The victim alleges that the incident happened at Achraf’s home in Paris while his wife Hiba Abouk was away to Dubai on holiday with their kids. The victim also stated that her and Hakimi had been speaking via social media since the
beginning of the year, and waited until last weekend where they met for the first time at the
footballers house. The only further details that were revealed about Hakimi’s actions towards the victim at the point of their meeting at “The footballer’s home is where things got out of control. Achraf kissed her on the mouth, lifted her clothes and kissed her breasts despite her refusal. He also practiced vaginal touching despite, again, her resistance.” According to media, the victim reported the case in the police station on Sunday where she accused him of rape. Rachel-Flore Pardo, the victim’s lawyer said in a statement that preliminary charges show “there is reliable and consistent evidence. My client made the choice to confide in justice, and only in justice, and will speak only to justice, and we won’t tolerate any smear or destabilization campaign” she said in a statement. At a news conference on Friday, PSG coach Christophe Galtier said he would answer no questions of a non-sporting nature (in relation to) Achraf Hakimi.
