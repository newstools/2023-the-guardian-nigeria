Senator Mohammed Ali Ndume, representing Borno South Senatorial District, has supported Maiduguri Monday Market (MMM) fire victims with N10 million. Ndume’s contribution brings to N2.41 billion donations to victims, as the Vice-President-elect, Kashim Shettima, and Chairman of the Tertiary Institutions Trust Fund (TETfund), Kashim Imam, Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe state, and the All Progressives Congress (APC) Chairman, Sen. Abdullahi Adamu each donated N100 million. The Borno State government had also released N2 billion to support the victims and commenced the rebuilding of the destroyed market worth about N500 billion. While presenting the cheque, on Saturday, at the market complex, Ndume said: “The doors are open for more donation in kind and finance from philanthropists, humanitarian agencies and the organised private sector (OPC).” He noted that the destroyed market should be urgently rebuilt, so that the affected traders and market women could recover their means of livelihoods. The General Manager of the market, Mustapha Loskuri, said 12, 999 shops were flattened in the six-hour fire, along Ahmadu Bello Way,  Sunday, February 26, 2023. He said the market built by the Mohammed Goni administration in 1979, had been providing jobs for over 65, 000 traders and market women in Maiduguri.
