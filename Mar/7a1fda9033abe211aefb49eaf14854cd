Chelsea were able to welcome back Reece James from injury for the second leg of their Champions League last-16 clash against Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday as the Blues aim to overturn a 1-0 first-leg deficit. However, £88 million ($106 million) January signing Mykhailo Mudryk was left on the bench for the fourth consecutive game by Graham Potter despite his side’s search for goals. Potter’s job is on the line against the German giants after a run of three wins in 16 games left Chelsea languishing in 10th in the Premier League and out of both domestic cups. Mudryk was selected as one of three January signings the English side could register for the knockout stage, but the Ukrainian has so far made a minimal impact. Potter has instead put his trust in the front three of Joao Felix, Kai Havertz and Raheem Sterling to end a barren run in front of goal. Marc Cucurella comes into the back three alongside Kalidou Koulibaly and Wesley Fofana with Thiago Silva absent through injury and Benoit Badiashile not registered. Dortmund make just two changes from the first leg as they aim to extended a 10-game winning run. Alexander Meyer starts in goal, while captain Marco Reus comes in for the injured Karim Adeyemi, who scored the only goal of the first leg.
