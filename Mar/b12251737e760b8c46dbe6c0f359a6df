Wesley Sneijder has urged Calvin Bassey to recognise his own weaknesses, as he took aim at his £19million price tag from Rangers, reports glasgowtimes.co.uk. The Nigerian international has struggled to make an impact at Ajax since he arrived at the Dutch giants last summer. Prior to his move, Bassey helped Rangers into the Europa League final and also lifted the Scottish Cup against Hearts at Hampden. Sneijder believes the defender has qualities, but he feels a lot of improvement is still needed if he is to become a regular for his Eredivise side. Speaking to Veronica Offside, he said: “I still think £19 million is too much. He plays at Ajax, so he will have to be able to play football. “He might be fantastic in another league. But he has a hard time when he has to play from the back. He can defend, but he has to find a middle ground in handing in the balls a little faster. “Knowing your own weaknesses is also a quality. When you realise that you have to hand the ball away quickly, otherwise things can go wrong.”
