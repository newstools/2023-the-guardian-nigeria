Governor Hope Uzodimma of Imo State has congratulated the President-elect, Bola Tinubu, on his victory in Saturday’s presidential election. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) declared Tinubu, candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), winner of the keenly contested poll, yesterday, defeating Atiku Abubakar of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and Peter Obi of Labour Party (LP). Uzodimma, in his congratulatory message, said: “The credibility and tenacity of the president-elect to offer selfless service to Nigeria has never been in doubt.
 “Over the past few months, we have toured the nooks and crannies of our country, preaching the message of ‘Renewed Hope,’ which is anchored on consolidation of gains made by President Muhammadu Buhari-led Federal Government. “With desires of the people and the quest for improved governance, the project was conceived and designed to deliver a transformed system of governance; one with the interest of the people at heart and a commitment to success. “It is exciting that after collation of results from all the states, and having satisfied requirements stipulated by our laws, INEC declared the candidate of our party winner and returned elected. “On behalf of the government and people of Imo, I congratulate Tinubu, and Shetima on their victory. “Tinubu is a man who, against all odds, transformed Lagos into an African prestigious metropolis, and, overtime, invested in human capital development across the nation.”
