The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has debunked a report alleging that its governor, Godwin Emefiele, was plotting against the president-elect, Bola Tinubu. A report from The Nation alleged that Emefiele has resolved to work against Tinubu because he failed to get the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential ticket and mobilised a sum of ₦500 million to the Labour Party governorship candidate in Lagos State Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour.

But CBN spokesperson Isa Abdulmumin in a statement said the allegation is false and malicious. He noted that Emefiele has never met or even spoken with Rhodes-Vivour either in person or through proxy. Abdulmumin also noted that the CBN governor does not take part in politics and therefore urges anyone with contrary information to prove the Governor wrong to provide facts. He added that the CBN governor and his team should be allowed to focus on their assigned tasks.
