â€¢ NRC resumes operation, insists on cash payment for services Activities are gradually taking the normal shape within the Lagos metropolis following the alleged crisis and concerns that trailed the recently concluded general elections. As of Monday, there were reports of pockets of violence at Balogun and Mandilas markets in Lagos Island between traders and hoodlums. It was alleged that some traders that went to the market on Monday morning to open their shops for business were attacked by hoodlums, who allegedly vandalised properties, and robbed victims. Because of this development, most shops and markets were closed for operations on Monday. However, normalcy has returned to the state as businesses resumed operations as witnessed by The Guardian, just as commuters and motorists complained of cash scarcity. From Oshodi to Mushin, Apapa to Oshodi, Oshodi to Berger, Oshodi to Iyana Ipaja and Iyana Ipaja to Iyana Iba, vehicles were seen moving freely without hindrances. A customer service representative, Tope Ogah, affirmed the state of normalcy, but complained about the lingering scarcity of cash. Ogah said he had to collect cash from a petty trader, usually known as Aboki, to commute to work on a daily basis. Meanwhile, the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC), yesterday, resumed operations, even as it insists on collecting cash for train operations. Nigerians have continued to lament over access to cash, especially with the new Naira swap in the country. One of the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said train operations resumed as announced by the management after its scheduled break for the elections. He said the corporation is still insisting on cash payment for its operations within Lagos to Ibadan route and also mass transit operating from Iddo in Lagos to Ijoko in Ogun State.
