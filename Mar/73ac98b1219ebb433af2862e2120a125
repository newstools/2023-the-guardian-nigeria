Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), yesterday, invalidated earlier declaration of House of Representatives Majority Leader, Alhassan Doguwa, as winner of Doguwa Tudun-Wada federal constituency of Kano State. It said supplementary elections shall be conducted in 13 polling units in Tudun-Wada area cancelled after the February 25 presidential and National Assembly elections. The electoral umpire had removed Doguwaâ€™s name from among members-elect and insisted he would not be issued certificate of return due to alleged manipulation of result. Doguwa, who was arrested and remanded by Kano Chief Magistrate Court at Gorundutse correctional custody for culpable homicide, was granted N500 million bail by Kano Federal High Court. Addressing journalists at INEC headquarter, yesterday, the Returning Officer (RO) for the area, Prof. Ibrahim Yakasai, said a supplementary poll would be conducted after proper review of the result. He added that INEC, in compliance with the Electoral Act, decided to review the results, noting that earlier declaration was made under duress.
