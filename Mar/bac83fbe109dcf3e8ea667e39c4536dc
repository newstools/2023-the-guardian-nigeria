Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) has opened an investigation over allegations of maltreatment of Nigeria-bound passengers by German carrier Lufthansa Airlines. General Manager, Public Affairs, NCAA, Sam Adurogboye, disclosed this in Lagos. Adurogboye said NCAA got a complaint over the alleged maltreatment of over 200 Nigeria-bound passengers. “I just got our Consumer Department and I was told that the report came in today and, as such, just beginning to do their investigation into the matter,” Adurogboye said. A flight bound for Lagos from Frankfurt which was meant to arrive at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport at 5:45 pm last Friday later arrived at 2:00 am after diverting to Cotonou, Republic of Benin, and Malabo in Equatorial Guinea. It was gathered that the aircraft had hovered over Lagos airport for an hour before heading for Cotonou. On arriving in Lagos at 2:00 am, the passengers asked the airline to make arrangements for their stay but the carrier reportedly threatened to call the police on them. Also, it was reported that Lagos airport was not closed contrary to the claim by the Lufthansa pilot. NCAA said it will make the outcome of its investigation into the matter public.
