A global impact firm, Palladium in partnership with Nigeria Network of NGOs (NNNGO), has developed information systems and public directory platform for civil society organisations to boost their operations in the Nigeria. Communications Lead, Nigeria Network of NGOs, Oyindamola Aramide, speaking at Stakeholder Engagement and Feedback Conference on the Civil Society Public Directory and Management Information System (MIS), in Lagos, said that the platform was created to promote accountability, transparency, and legitimacy for the society. Executive Director, NNNGO, Oyebisi Oluseyi, said regulations were vital for the development of any sector, adding that the initiative had created tools and systems that aided not only statutory regulatory compliance but also self-regulation while paying attention to capacity strengthening and growth for Nigerian CSOs using technology. “We are excited to be at the centre of this huge development in the history of the Nigerian third sector, ” he said. Following about 6 regional consultations to conceptualise the platform’s design, we are again deepening the consultation today, moving from conception to practice in ways that ensures we can define user experience for the MIS and Public Directory through learning, collaboration, and consultation,” Oyebisi added. He stated that the platform was designed to allow information provided to be verified using algorithms supported by Artificial Intelligence; accessible to people living with disability and organisations in hard-to-reach areas while ensuring that organisations have access to tools to develop their capacities across a range of areas. He said the platforms would be useful to government, regulators, development partners, donors and CSO themselves in identifying Nigerian CSOs, their activities, partners, promote collaboration, good governance, capacity development and inspiring confidence and trust in the activities of civil society organisations.
 
The platform was developed as part of activities under the project Strengthening Civic Advocacy and Local Engagements (SCALE) supported by United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and aim to create a system that allows for civil society growth through ensuring visibility, self-regulation, learning, and experience sharing among the different levels within the civil society community.”
