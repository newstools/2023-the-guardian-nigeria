All Progressives Congress (APC) Presidential Campaign Committee (PCC) in Oyo State has dismissed any standing agreement between the president-elect, Bola Tinubu, and Governor Seyi Makinde of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), as being speculated ahead of the March 11, 2023 governorship poll. In a statement signed by the Chairman, Central Media Presidential Gubernatorial Council, Mr. Kehinde Olaosebikan, the party said Makinde was only deceiving his members. A member of the PCC, Nike Ajagbe, said Tinubu’s visit to Makinde on Thursday, February 16, 2023, during the presidential rally in Ibadan, had nothing to do with endorsement of the governor. She described the president-elect as a party man, who cannot joke with the success of his party across the country, especially the South West, which is regarded as his stronghold. Ajagbe explained that it was in the programme of the APC PCC to visit all the opposition governors whenever they are in their state for campaign; hence, nobody should see it as endorsement, but a privilege to host a widely accepted presidential candidate. Her words: “Being the governor of the state, the president-elect only visited Makinde as he did to other opposition governors whenever he visited their states.”
