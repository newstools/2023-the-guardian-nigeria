Former Super Eagles winger, Edema Fuludu, wants Napoli star, Victor Osimhen, to hasten his plans of moving his soccer career to England. “Osimhen has established himself as one of the best strikers in Europe, but taking his soccer trade to the English Premier League will be more beneficial to him in monetarily and publicity-wise,” Fuludu told The Guardian, yesterday. The Napoli striker, who is wanted by a host of English top-flight clubs, including Manchester United, Chelsea and Arsenal, would cost a huge fee as he still has two years left on his current deal. He is the Italian top-flight’s top scorer this season, having netted 19 goals in 21 appearances, and has become Napoli’s most important player on their way to establishing an astonishing 15 point lead at the top of the table. The 24-year-old ramped up transfer speculation on Monday when he said after emerging as the 2022 Best Foreign Athlete in Italy that he is working hard to one day play in the Premier League. “A lot of people worldwide consider the Premier League as the best and the strongest league, but now I am in one of the best leagues in the world, which is the Italian Serie A.” Fuludu, who played club football for New Nigerian Bank, BCC Lions and Julius Berger in Nigeria, as well as Altay FC in Turkey, is of the opinion that the time is ripe for Osimhen to move from Italian Serie A to English Premier League. “Most top footballers in the world, who could not seize the opportunity of playing in the English Premier League retired with tales of regret. I want Osimhen to hasten his plan of moving to the EPL for a number of reasons. Apart from making more money in England, Osimhen will attract more TV mileage and I am sure the English press will fall in love with him because of his scoring ability,” Fuludu, a member of Nigeria’s victorious squad to Tunisia ‘94 African Cup of Nations, said.
