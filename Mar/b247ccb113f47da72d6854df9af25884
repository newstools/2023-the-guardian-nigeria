Grief and lamentations took centre stage in Enugu, yesterday, as concerned residents took to the streets to protest against the murder of the Labour Party Senatorial Candidate, Oyibo Chukwu, last Wednesday. Chukwu, the Labour Party senatorial candidate for Enugu East, was assassinated along Amaechi-Awkunanaw Road, Enugu South Local Council with six others, on their way home after a campaign. Their assassins, who shot severally at Chukwu’s Sienna car, also set it ablaze together with the occupants. Yesterday, several residents led by the former state Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Ben Nwoye, had trooped to the streets to protest the killing with a call for the apprehension and prosecution of those behind the act. Dressed in black attire with bold inscription, “Enugu mourns Oyibo”, and banners bearing pictures of the slain politician, they chanted mournful songs as they marched. Some of the inscriptions on the banner included: “Oyibo lives on,” “Too hard to believe,” “You will be forever in our hearts,” among others. At the premises of the Enugu High Court, the mourners began to sing: “Arise, Oh Lord, let our enemies be shattered…” which they sang severally before embarking on prayers in cry for justice. “They have slain our brother. We are here before the court of man, but we know that there is a God of justice and we are calling on you to make available instruments that we bring justice in this matter. We present Oyibo and others murdered the same day before you. Let their blood continue to speak. We pray you use men of goodwill to speak justice and equity for Enugu State. Oyibo will not die in vain,” they prayed. From the Enugu High Court, the protesters marched through the Bissalla Road, Independence Layout, Ogui Road,Obiagu Road and other parts of the state, calling for justice for the slain lawyer.
