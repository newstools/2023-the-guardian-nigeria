Labour Party candidate for Okigwe North Federal Constituency, Prince Chikwem Onuoha, has rejected the declaration of Miriam Onuoha of the All Progressive Congress (APC), by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), as the winner of last Saturday’s poll. He said the declaration was done in error, and did not reflect the will of the people, as it should be reviewed and reversed within 42 hours in the interest of peace in the area.
Onuoha, who made the call in Owerri, yesterday, while reacting to outcome of the elections, insisted that the poll was “marred by irregularities and subversion of the people’s mandate.” He said: “Shockingly, Onuoha manufactured results from wards where election never held. She allocated votes to political parties, ridiculously gave herself over 30,000 votes and connived with corrupt elements in INEC to declare her winner. “This fraud from Onuoha and her cohorts is not only legally offensive, but morally nauseating. How did someone, who lost her ward to me, score over 30,000 plus votes in a council that rarely gives candidates 10,000 votes cumulatively since 1999?”
