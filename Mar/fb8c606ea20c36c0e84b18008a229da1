Edo State Government has alerted security agencies to alleged plans by former Governor of the state, Adams Oshiomhole, to disrupt the Saturday, March 11 elections. In a statement, the Special Adviser to the Governor on Media Projects, Crusoe Osagie, said the government has received credible information of how the former governor has continued to go around communities with a history of violence to engage and mobilise thugs to disrupt the polls across the state. The statement reads: “We are privy to information that Adams Oshiomhole has been visiting communities across Benin City, where he has been engaging with thugs in these communities. The brief, we understand, is for them to intimidate and unleash mayhem on voters so that the All Progressives Congress (APC) can proceed with their rigging as was done in the presidential election. “We are alerting security agencies to these clandestine meetings that the former governor has been holding because it has the tendency to spiral into loss of lives and wanton destruction of property. “It is, therefore, necessary for the security agencies to take note of the activities of the former governor and put him on their watch list because his propensity for violence has been well advertised in the past.” The governor’s aide noted that Edo people must be watchful and be wary of the antics of Oshiomhole, who has allegedly contracted thugs to disrupt the polls on Saturday, March 11, across the state.
