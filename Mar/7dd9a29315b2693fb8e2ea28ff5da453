This sort of marginalisation has propelled women all over the world and in all sectors to speak up in one voice against such inequity. The International Women’s Day themed DigitALL: Innovation and technology for gender equality by the United Nation, aims for inclusion of women in the world of innovation and technology. The UN notes that globally, 69 per cent of men have access to the Internet compared to 63 per cent of women regardless of the availability of digitisation in daily lives. This reiterates the gender gap as seen in the digital world. The UN lends its voice to the struggle for women’s rights and equality, this clamour for equality can be traced back to the late 18th and early 19th centuries, with the first wave of feminism.
Women’s suffrage, or the right to vote, was a central issue during this time, and it wasn’t until the early 20th century that many countries began to grant women this right. The second wave of feminism began in the 1960s, and it focused on issues such as reproductive rights, equal pay, and sexual harassment. This movement helped to bring about significant changes in laws and attitudes toward women, but there is still much work to be done to achieve true gender equality. In recent years, the #MeToo movement and other social justice movements have brought renewed attention to the ongoing struggle for women’s rights and equality. Women continue to face systemic discrimination and inequality in many areas of life, and it is important that we continue to listen to their voices and work towards a more just and equal society. In society, women play a crucial role in their families and society at large. They are not only responsible for nurturing and caring for their families, but they are the backbone of any community and contribute significantly to the economic and social development of their communities. The impact of women can be seen in various areas, including education, health, politics, and the economy. The celebration of International Women’s Day on March 8 dates back to the early 20th century. The day was first observed as National Women’s Day in the United States in 1909. It was initiated by the Socialist Party of America to commemorate a strike by women garment workers in New York City who were protesting against their working conditions. This fight also stretched into demanding for their rights, including the right to vote, better working conditions, and equal pay. The idea of an international women’s day emerged in 1910, when Clara Zetkin, a German socialist and feminist, proposed the idea at the International Conference of Working Women in Copenhagen. The first International Women’s Day was observed on March 19, 1911, in Austria, Denmark, Germany, and Switzerland. IWD, as it is called, recognises the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women. This day raises awareness about the challenges and issues that women still face globally. The aim of celebrating International Women’s Day is to promote gender equality, raise awareness about women’s issues, and highlight their contributions to society. It is also an opportunity to celebrate the achievements of women and recognise their role in promoting positive change in society. The first International Women’s Day was celebrated in 1911, and since then, it has been observed yearly. The day is marked by various events, including rallies, conferences, and marches, to promote women’s rights and gender equality. While women seem to have been marginalised based on various researches, the global trend is now moving away from the gender-based leadership role. This is why it is now necessary to inculcate that into the African settings as well. While the theme for this year is women in technology, it is important to note the evolution of African women who are making differences too, amidst oceans of challenges. Below is a list of the selected ones, and this isn’t to discredit the many beautiful and courageous women out there making a difference in their different walks of life. Funke Opeke: A Nigerian entrepreneur and founder of Main One Cable Company, which provides broadband internet services in West Africa. She has been recognized for her contributions to improving internet connectivity in Africa. Juliana Rotich: A Kenyan technologist, entrepreneur, and founder of BRCK, a company that provides rugged, mobile WiFi routers for use in areas with limited internet access. She is also the co-founder of Ushahidi, a platform that crowdsources crisis information. Dr. Aisha Walcott-Bryant: A computer scientist and expert in human-computer interaction who has worked on developing accessible technology for people with disabilities. While the list above is few, hundreds of women who deserve all the necessary celebrations. To these women we tag it, every day as an international women’s day for them. Yet, it must be admitted that the war within is not solved completely, flipping through different research articles, and speaking to various agents of age, the boldly written items remain our challenge collectively if we must grow. Gender bias in performance evaluations: Research has found that men and women are evaluated differently in performance appraisals, with women being more likely to receive negative feedback and less likely to be promoted than men, even when their performance is similar or better than their male colleagues. Gender discrimination in hiring: Studies have shown that women are less likely to be hired for jobs that are traditionally male dominated, even when they have the same qualifications as male candidates. Gender pay gap: Research has found that on the average , women are paid 21 per cent less than their male counterparts, earning less than men for doing the same job, even when factors such as education, experience, and job performance are taken into account. It also highlights that women are more likely to experience sexual harassment in the workplace than men, with men often being the perpetrators. And this statistics calls on the need for change which will in turn give room for more female inclusion. Stereotyping: Studies have found that women are often stereotyped and perceived as less competent and less committed to their jobs than men, even when they have the same level of education and experience as their male colleagues. Overall, these findings suggest that women are still facing significant barriers and challenges in the workplace and that more needs to be done to address gender inequality and promote gender equity. In terms of education, women have been instrumental in breaking down barriers and promoting equal opportunities for all. Women’s education is critical to the development of any society as they have played a key role in the fight for girls’ education and have made significant strides in increasing access to education for women and girls worldwide. As more women receive education, they are better equipped to make informed decisions, contribute to the economy, and raise educated and empowered children in communities and societies at large. In society, women make invaluable contributions in various fields such as education, healthcare, politics, science, and technology. They are agents of change, advocates of human rights, and drivers of progress. Women have been breaking down barriers and challenging gender stereotypes to pave the way for future generations of girls and women. In the health sector, women have played a vital role in improving maternal and child health outcomes. They are often the primary caregivers in their families and communities, and as such, are well-positioned to promote healthy behaviors and prevent diseases. Women also play a critical role in promoting reproductive health and family planning. In politics, women are increasingly taking up leadership roles and contributing to decision-making processes at all levels. Women leaders bring a unique perspective to governance, which is often informed by economic contribution women play a significant role in the economy, from being business owners and entrepreneurs to working in different sectors, including healthcare, education, and technology. Their contribution to the economy cannot be overlooked. According to the World Bank’s Women, Business, and the Law 2022 report, 2.4 billion women of working age do not have access to equitable economic opportunities, and 178 nations continue to erect legislative obstacles that limit their ability to fully engage in economic life. 95 countries do not guarantee equal pay for equal work, and women are subject to some type of job restriction in 86 of those nations. In social development, women are often the primary caregivers in families, and their role in nurturing children has a significant impact on society’s social development. They are also instrumental in promoting values such as empathy, compassion, and kindness.
In spheres like politics, women’s participation in politics has increased over the years, and they are making a significant impact in decision-making processes. This participation helps to promote gender equality and ensures that women’s voices are heard and their interests are represented. International Women’s Day aims to celebrate the achievements of women, raise awareness of gender inequality, and advocate for women’s rights and empowerment.
