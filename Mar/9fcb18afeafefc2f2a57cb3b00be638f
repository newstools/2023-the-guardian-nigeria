They can be made from any variety of grape, but Thompson Seedless grapes are most commonly used. The process of making raisins involves drying the grapes, either in the sun or in dehydrators, until the water content is around 15%. This can take several weeks. Raisins have a variety of health benefits, such as being high in antioxidants and providing a good source of iron, potassium and other minerals. They are also a natural source of sugar and can be a healthy alternative to added sugars in baked goods and other recipes. There are several types of raisins, including seedless varieties such as Thompson Seedless and seeded varieties such as Muscat. Other types of raisins include Sultanas, which are made from a different variety of grape, and Golden Raisins which are treated with sulfur dioxide to preserve their light colour. Raisins can be eaten on their own as a snack, added to cereal, oatmeal, or yoghurt, or used in baking, such as in bread, cakes and cookies. They can also be used in savoury dishes, such as added to stuffing for poultry or pork. Raisins can be used in unique ways such as adding them to a marinade for meat, in a salad, or in a chutney. They can also be used to make a natural sweetener by soaking them in water and blending them, then straining the mixture.
