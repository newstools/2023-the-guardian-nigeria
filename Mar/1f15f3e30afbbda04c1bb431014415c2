As Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) joined International Civil Defence Organisations (ICDO) to celebrate the World Civil Defence Day, the Delta State commandant, Mr. Jimoh Suleiman Agboola, urged Nigeria and Africa nations to embrace information technology to win “the war against insecurity, cybercrimes and other techno-crimes.” Agboola, who assumed office in Asaba recently, marked World Civil Defence Day 2023 with the theme: “The role of information technology in risk assessment.” He stated that the impact and importance of information technology in the fight against insecurity globally, especially in the sub-saharan Africa, could not be over emphasized, stating the need “to consider it not just as a trend but an approach that should be embraced and developed, if the world must over come criminal activities.” Agboola expressed optimism that information technology in the assessment of the risk level in the fight against insecurity and other technologically-driven crimes and vices would impact positively in achieving a safer and crime free world.
