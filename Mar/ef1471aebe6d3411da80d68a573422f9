Labour Party chairman Julius Abure has dissolved the executive council of the party in Rivers State. Abure in a statement said the council was dissolved for gross anti-party activities and corruption in the management of Labour Party funds. The party’s action comes a few hours after the state council endorsed the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate, Sim Fubara, for the Saturday, March 11 election. The Labour Party noted that it is in its interest and that of “the Obidient movement in Rivers State that those who were at the helm of affairs in Rivers State when our presidential mandate was openly stolen in Rivers State should step aside until full investigation is completed on what happened on that day. “The National Chairman has lost confidence in the ability of the compromised State Executive Council led by Mr Deinye Pepple to lead the campaign for the gubernatorial and … State House of Assembly elections come March 11th.” He urges all Obidients in Rivers State to disregard every comment made by the disgraced State Chairman of the Labour Party, Deinye Pepple, on the election of March 11th and reiterates the full backing of the Labour Party on the candidacy of Comrade Beatrice Itubo of the Labour Party as the next Governor of Rivers State. He, therefore, urged all Obidients to come out massively on March 11 to vote for Comrade Beatrice Itubo of Labour Party.
