Crisis in the Rivers State chapter of All Progressives Congress (APC) has continued five days to governorship and state House of Assembly elections, as party members accuse one another of anti-party activities. A party chieftain and former  Chief of Staff to Ex-Governor Chibuike Amaechi,  Mr. Tony Okocha,  told Port Harcourt residents, yesterday, he did not know the  party’s governorship candidate for Saturday’s election. While speaking in a Port Harcourt-based radio  programme  Okocha  said Tonye Cole has not proved to members of the party that  he is their guber  candidate  because, according to him, he (Cole) was allegedly engaged in anti-party activities, by voting for the  Peoples Democratic Party presidential candidate,  Alhaji Atiku Abubakar. Okocha claimed such actions were responsible for APC’s stagnation and failure in the state. Okocha said: “The facts are clear that he (Cole)  voted against his party’s presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu. If you and other members refused to vote the presidential candidate and someone else in another party did, it is necessary we reciprocate the gesture.” But in his reaction,  the  APC spokesman, Darlington Nwauju, wondered how Okocha, whom he claimed is not a non-party  member,  would know  its governorship candidate. A short message sent to The Guardian  by Nwauju  queried: “How can a non-APC member know who our candidate is?”
