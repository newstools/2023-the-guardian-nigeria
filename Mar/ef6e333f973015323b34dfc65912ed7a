Executive Secretary (ED), Bauchi State Primary Health Care Development Agency (BSPHCDA), Dr. Rilwanu Mohammed, has said that Governor Bala Mohammed approved employment of 100 medical doctors, last year, but only 15 applied and 13 accepted the offers. Speaking on the state’s health contributory scheme, during an event organised by Journalists for Public Health and Development Initiative (J4PD), yesterday, Mohammed said the vulnerable were not visiting the healthcare facilities, despite monthly fund allocations. The programme was sponsored by Integrated Health Program (IHP) of United States Agency for International Development (USAID). He said the government approved the engagement of doctors to strengthen the sector. “The employment is an open one. We are waiting for more doctors to apply, but I think the enabling environment is what they are emphasising. Most of the doctors are coming from other places and there are certain allowances that should go to them, which the government is not paying.” “On the other side, the (Abubakar Tafawa Balewa) Teaching Hospital is paying those allowances. Our doctors are running there and leaving the state. If you give them employment, there is N60,000 difference between the state and federal per month,” he said. Explaining that the difference in funding and consulting opportunities attracted the doctors to the teaching hospital, the ED urged the government to provide enabling environment for the healthcare providers.  He commended Governor Bala Mohammed for the employment of over 1,000 other healthcare workers. Meanwhile, the Bauchi State Health Contributory Scheme (BSHCS) said 134,333 citizens have been enrolled into the scheme as at February 2023. Also, the Coordinator of J4PD, Elizabeth Kahh, said the health journalists would continue to sensitise the people in the rural communities on healthcare development.
