Former Postmaster General of the Federation, Dr. Ismail Adewusi, has described the victory of the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, in last Saturday’s polls, as reward for tenacity and the unrelenting pursuit of vision.

Adewusi, who is a member of the Policy, Research and Strategy (CRS) and the Grassroots Mobilisation and Orientation Directorates of the APC Presidential Campaign Council (APC PCC), said the President-elect’s road to victory is a lesson for all, saying: “Here is a victory that carries with it a heavy dose of lessons for humanity. He had set his eyes on the ball and never for once took his eyes off that goal.” The former governorship aspirant in Oyo State, who was Commissioner for Finance and later Budget and Economic Planning under Tinubu in Lagos, said since his path and that of Tinubu crossed over three decades ago, he had known him as a tenacious man, never giving up until he achieves his target. “Serving as his Commissioner for Finance, at perhaps, the most turbulent period, when the monthly allocation of Lagos State was stopped by the Olusegun Obasanjo-led Federal Government, was an eye-opener. “At a time when the sole aim of that action by the Federal Government was to cripple Tinubu’s administration and force him to succumb to the whims of the centre over the constitutional right of the state to create more local governments, Tinubu grew more resolute and put all of us to task.

That was the beginning of the real deal for Lagos in terms of revenue generation,” Adewusi said. Noting that Tinubu has always been firm in his convictions, Adewusi said he has no doubt that this tenacity of purpose and strong capacity for visionary ideas are what the incoming Nigerian president would be bringing to the table. “He has what it takes to take courageous decisions. Those decisions might appear, at first, to be tall orders, but in the end, they always prove more enduring and comforting,” he said. He expressed optimism that Nigeria’s socio-economic crises of the last few years would soon fizzle out, saying what global investors needed were indicators to the fact that Nigeria has capable, responsible and responsive leadership.
