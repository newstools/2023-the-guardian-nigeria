The member representing Nkanu East/West Federal Constituency, Nnoli Nnaji, has described last Saturday’s elections, in which the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) lost seven House of Representatives seats in Enugu State, as a “tsunami.” Nnaji, the only PDP House of Representatives member, who won his re-election in the state, stated that the loss by the party was a sad one, which members would not forget in a hurry. He told reporters, yesterday, that he is hopeful that the party had learnt its lessons from the defeat, and would come out stronger in the March 11 governorship and state Assembly elections, even as he thanked the people of his constituency for voting him back to office. He said: “I thank the people of the constituency for coming out to vote for me. One thing about politics is that if you are elected, you have to work for the people. I believe I have worked for the people and they gave it back to me. I thank them for their effort in giving it back to me, and I know I will do better.”
