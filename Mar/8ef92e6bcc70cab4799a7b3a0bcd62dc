Nigeria’s male cyclist, Kurotimi Abaka, has qualified for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games by winning a gold medal at the Class B Tendam elite men’s category at the 19th African Road Cycling Championship in Ghana. Excited by his feat, Abaka has called on the Nigeria Cycling Federation (NCF) to work towards improving the standard of the sport in the country. Abaka said Nigerian cyclists, over the years, are confronted with challenges of getting standard bicycles, regular competitions and good welfare packages, which are important for their development in the sport. “Nigerian cyclists would appreciate the federation if it gives more attention to development of the sport. Nigeria has talented cyclists, who, with adequate support, can be worthy ambassadors at international tournaments,” he said. Speaking on Abaka’s victory at the African Championship in Ghana, an NCF board member, Femi Thomas congratulated the cyclist for making Nigeria and Africa proud and promised that the cycling body will work hard to make the sport less tedious. “The federation is already discussing with sponsors to help in taking cycling to greater heights.” We recently acquired a vehicle (Ford Range), which is part of our rebranding strategy to attract sponsors,” Thomas said.
 
Thomas, an ex athlete, who doubles as chairman of Ogun State Cycling Association, promised that this year would be better than last year for cyclists and officials, saying that the NCF has programmes to make the sport better. Twelve cyclists, comprising 11 women and one man, represented Nigeria at the 19th African Road Cycling Championships in Ghana.
