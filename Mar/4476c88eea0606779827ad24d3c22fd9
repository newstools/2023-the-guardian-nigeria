The 47-year-old posted on Instagram shared a caption that read “50 Cent Ready To Seize Ex-Employee’s Property Over $6M Lawsuit. Look I’m a need that by Monday!” wrote the rap mogul, legal name Curtis Jackson, in the caption. The piece itself went into detail about the legal dispute between the former G-Unit rapper  and Mitchell Green, the former brand management director of champagne company Le Chemin du Roi. Media reports suggests that Green exaggerated the cost of the good and took kickbacks from distributors who collected $2.2 million in “agency fees.”
