Rivers United recorded their second victory in as many games, yesterday, beating Congo Kinshasha’s Motema Pembe 3-1 to climb to the top of Group B in the CAF Confederation Cup. Yesterday’s victory over the Congolese side was Rivers United’s third in a row after their opening day 0-3 loss to Diables Noir of Congo Brazzaville. Hat-trick hero, Paul Acquah, a Ghanaian, showed early in the game that the Stanley Eguma boys were in serious business, as he terrorised the visitors’ rear throughout the game. Although Motema Pembe were a tough knot to untie in the first half, Rivers United still found the way to force in their first goal in the 45th minute when Acquah headed home a teasing cross from Ukeme Williams to soothe the nerves of the home fans. Ten minutes into the second half, Acquah was at it again, this time making good use of a tee up by compatriot, Emmanuel Ampiah, to make it 2-0. DC Motema Pembe pulled one back in the 78th minute when substitute Mydo Nakouho tucked in a rebound off his initial header. Not ready to allow their opponents dream of an equaliser, Rivers United upped the tempo in the stoppage time and were rewarded with a third goal, again through the prolific Acquah. Yesterday’s win took Rivers United’s points tally to nine and one victory away from qualification to the next round. Next for the Pride of Rivers is another home game against Diables Noirs.
