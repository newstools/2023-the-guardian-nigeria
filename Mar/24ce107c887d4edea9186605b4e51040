The Duchess of Sussex looked splendid and chic in her all-black ensemble that cost approximately $12,500 as she was spotted leaving a Mexican restaurant after having brunch. The breakdown of the whole look goes thus; Valentino slides ($770), a black Max Mara cashmere coat ($6000), a Chanel stitch bag ($5,600) and sunglasses from
Valentino ($200). It was reported that she took all the female employees from her Archwell team out for a luncheon in celebration of International Women’s Day. For that day, Archwell collaborated with Harvest Home, an organization that supports pregnant women by providing housing, wellbeing support and programs that equip women to become great mothers. Meghan’s ensemble for the day was truly sophisticated, consisting of an airy sweater, matching pants and a Max and Mara black lengthy cashmere coat paired with a pair of white pointed-toe Valentino mules. Her black and white Chanel bag took a modern turn with its silver chain strap that perfectly fitted her off-duty look. Keeping it minimalistic, her makeup was au naturel, and her hair pulled up into a messy bun.
