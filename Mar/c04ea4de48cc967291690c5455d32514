Armed bandits have killed a six-month pregnant woman and four others, and abducted 50 people, leaving many injured in Rafi Local Council of Niger State.
   
The Guardian learnt that the bandits stormed the community shooting sporadically, but their attack was repelled by military on aerial patrol, who engaged them in gun duel.
 
The bandits, who were unable to withstand the fierce aerial battle, took to their heels but not without abducting 50 people, mostly women and children.
