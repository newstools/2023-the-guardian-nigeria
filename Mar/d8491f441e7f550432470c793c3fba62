It is the losers’ final, but a win for either Nigeria or Tunisia will compensate, to an extent, for their inability to qualify for tomorrow’s gold medal game at the ongoing African U-20 Cup of Nations holding in Egypt. Nigeria lost their semifinal game to The Gambia 0-1, just as Senegal defeated Tunisia 3-0 in their last four game on Monday. All the four teams remaining in the competition have already qualified for this year’s FIFA U-20 World Cup billed to hold in Indonesia, but victory will give the winner sometime extra to celebrate after three weeks of competition in Egypt. Following Monday’s loss to The Gambia, the Flying Eagles rested on Tuesday and returned to training on Wednesday ahead of the game, which kicks off at the Cairo International Stadium by 4.00 p.m. in Egypt, which is 3.00 p.m. in Nigeria. Confederation of African Football (CAF), yesterday, appointed Mohamed Athoumani from The Comoros Islands as the centre referee for the match, with Fanta Idriss Kone (Mali), as assistant referee 1 and Soukaina Hamdi as assistant referee 2. The Gambia’s Lamin Jammeh from will serve as fourth official, Bouhtane Said from The Comoros will serve as match commissioner, while Imade El Fahouss from Morocco is the general coordinator. Meanwhile, Flying Eagles’ players are expected to get $5,000 each for qualifying for the FIFA U-20 World Cup. The Flying Eagles booked their passage to the U-20 World Cup when they defeated Uganda 1-0 in the quarterfinal of the competition. Nigeria, Senegal, Tunisia and The Gambia qualified for the Junior World Cup, which draw will hold on March 31.
