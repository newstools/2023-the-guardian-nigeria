Napoli striker Victor Osimhen has opened up on the possibility of plying his trade in the Premier League following reported interest from Arsenal and Manchester United. Osimhen is the current top scorer in the Italian Serie A with 19 goals and leading the charge for Napoli’s first league title since the 1989/1990 season. The 24-year-old Nigerian striker’s performance for Napoli has attracted interest from top European clubs. Osimhen received the Best Foreign Athlete award by the Italian Foreign Press Association where he spoke of his desire of playing in the Premier League, “Playing in one of the top five leagues in the world is an amazing feeling for me. A lot of people world wide consider the Premier League as the best and the strongest league but I’m in a process,” Osimhen said. “I’m in a place now I’m in one of the best leagues in the world, the Italian Serie A. Of course I’m working so hard to achieve my dream in playing in the Premier League some day.” While Arsenal are courting the Nigerian, Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand has tipped his former club as a perfect destination of Osimhen. “I think United are looking to sign a striker, there’s no secrets around it,” Ferdinand said as quoted by Manchester Evening News. “Wout Weghorst was maybe a short-term option, although I think he has offered a lot and is doing everything that the manager would have wanted. “There are two options that jump out at you. I think Victor Osimhen, in terms of form and being that out-and-out number nine striker, is arguably in better form than anyone in the world at the moment.” Osimhen, however, said that he remains focused on helping Napoli win the Serie A title at the end of the season before deciding on his next destination.
