You would disagree with me less.
Battered and abused by the industry and blacklisted after being sexually assaulted, Brendan Fraser finally laid his hands on the biggest of them all. An Oscar. But here are top-notch films you probably have forgotten Brendan Fraser played lead roles. Some are arguably more suspense-filled than the whales. George Of The Jungle 1997
George, George Goerge of the jungle watch out for that …tree”. Five years after Encino Man comes George of the Jungle: a wacky yet witty slapstick comedy that introduced Fraser to the millennial audience. Raised by gorillas in the jungle, George is a clumsy Tarzan who slams into a lot of trees and falls in love with a wandering traveller from San Francisco. George instantly became an icon for younger audiences with this film, giving Fraser what would turn out to be a supportive demographic of young adults down the line.

The Mummy Returns 2001
To reprise the most Fraser-y role of his career, Brendan Fraser returns as Rick O’Connell in The Mummy Returns. While this sequel was certainly not as celebrated as the first, it still absolutely delivers the action-packed comedy that audiences loved. Besides a fairly silly CGI Dwayne Johnson towards the end, this film doubles down on the action from the first film and makes it work in its way. Either way, Brendan comes ready to play with the same over-the-top energy that was required of him to make this movie a worthy sequel. Journey To The Centre Of The Earth 2008
Trying to find the missing puzzle to what happened to his brother, a scientist. He will spend ten days with his uncle while his mother, Elizabeth, prepares to move to Canada. She gives a box to Trevor that belonged to his missing brother, Max, and Trevor finds a book with references to the last journey of his brother. He decides to follow the steps Max with Sean and they travel to Iceland, where they meet the guide Hannah Ásgeirsson. While climbing a mountain, there is a thunderstorm and they protect themselves in a cave. However, a lightening collapses the entrance, and the trio is trapped in the cave.

Encino Man 1992
Fraser plays a caveman trapped in the ice for aeons that is thawed out by a couple of dolts (Astin, Shore) after finding him in their backyard and deciding to give him the grand tour of their neighbourhood in this dumbbell comedy that’s not without its charm. It demonstrates the young Brendan’s ability to showcase his physical comedy side since his dialogue is pretty minimal. A great flick to see if you’re in high school and a little stoned. Or even a lot stoned. The film is quite an interesting sight and deserves to be second on our list.

Bedazzled 2000
Released in 2000, the film depicts how Fraser used his granted wishes to achieve his aims. Gelbart (“MASH”) and Tolan “(The Larry Sanders Show,” “Rescue Me”) were writers and Ramis (“Groundhog Day,” “Caddyshack”) directed this romantic comedy that cast Fraser as a nerdy IT worker who is granted seven wishes by a fetchingly sexy version of Satan (Hurley) – all to gain the attention of a co-worker (O’Connor). Fraser is appropriately charming, and the concept is played out with cleverness and panache. Brendan Fraser is now a household name in the film industry, and his latest success shouldn’t just be credited to his incredible role in the whales. There were and would still be film from the superstar in the nearest of times. Till then cheers to him.
