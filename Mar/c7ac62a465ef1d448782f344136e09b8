He noted that the creation of Commandant General’s Special Intelligence Squad and Anti – Vandal Monitoring Squad as well as establishment of desk officers for human rights and persons with disabilities have helped in tackling insecurity in the country. He commended officers and men of the Command, on their professional conduct during the Presidential and National Assembly elections in the state.

Similarly, Agboola, who has assumed office in Asaba, said the use of information technology in the fight against insecurity globally, especially in sub-Saharan Africa is crucial.
