Former Flying Eagles Coach, John Obuh, has advised the national U-20 technical crew, led by Ladan Bosso, to rise above Monday’s semifinal defeat in the hands of The Gambia and focus on making the team stronger for the FIFA U-20 World Cup scheduled for Indonesia from May 20 to June 11. Obuh told The Guardian in the wake of Flying Eagles’ semifinals loss at the ongoing African U-20 Nations Cup in Egypt the Flying Eagles have potential of making remarkable impact at the world championship, adding, however, that the team must be rejigged to a higher standard. He urged the coaches to start preparations for the World Cup immediately because the opposition in Indonesia would be bigger and more tactical than those at the African championship. “The Flying Eagles should focus on the World Cup now and forget about not making it to the final of the AFCON. Nigeria has never won the U-20 World Cup and the coaches need to inject new players into the squad to achieve the World Cup dream. “Failure to win the U-20 AFCON does not mean the Flying Eagles cannot win the FIFA World Cup. There is enough time for the coaches to blend the team and play quality friendlies before the global competition.” Obuh also called on the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) to help the Flying Eagles’ coaches by providing them with all they need to excel in Indonesia.
