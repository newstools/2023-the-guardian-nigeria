There were also reports of her loved ones trying to get her help but no one could truly specify what the problem was. Cara Delevingne, 30 year old model and actress, opened up about her journey to sobriety in an exclusive interview with Vogue. Cara shared that she is now over 4 months sober – a positive decision she made from the embarrassment she felt after seeing the disturbing pictures that were taken of her at the airport at Los Angeles. “It’s heartbreaking because I thought I was having fun, but at some point it was like, ‘OK, I don’t look well,'” she said. “You know, sometimes you need a reality check, so in a way those pictures were something to be grateful for.” Cara defined the moment as a wake up call for her: “You know, sometimes you need a reality check, so in a way those pictures were something to be grateful for.” She also stated that she knew she had to change anyways “because the way that I was living was not sustainable.” Cara shared her struggle with alcohol, mental health, insomnia, dyspraxia and how she’d had people that staged “interventions of a sort” but she resisted. “This process obviously has its ups and downs, but I’ve started realizing so much,” she said. “People want my story to be this after-school special where I just say, ‘Oh look, I was an addict, and now I’m sober and that’s it.’ And it’s not as simple as that. It doesn’t happen overnight. … Of course I want things to be instant — I think this generation especially, we want things to happen quickly — but I’ve had to dig deeper.”
