Rather than resort to inciting statements capable of causing ill feeling and violence in the country, aggrieved political parties and their supporters have been enjoined to seek redress in the court of law to address their grievances.

Security Consultant, Mr. Matthew Ibadin, who made this call in Lagos, yesterday, while addressing newsmen on the victory of the Presidential Candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate, Senator Bola Tinubu, said in a game, one was bound to win while the other, lose. Congratulating Tinubu as the President-elect, Ibadin said the result of the election may not have gone down well with some Nigerians, following the call by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Labour Party and other parties for cancellation of the election due to alleged irregularities. He posited that while every Nigerian has right to choose his candidate in an election, those who ultimately lost such election have the right to seek redress in the court of law but not through violent street protest.

He urged all presidential candidates who lost in the election to appeal to their supporters for calm while they seek legal redress. The security consultant, who has consistently advocated for a peaceful and progressive Nigeria, remarked that though some political party candidates feel seriously disappointed by INEC’s conduct of the election, they should place the collective interest of the country above other considerations in seeking to right the wrongs they may have perceived in the electoral process. While Nigerians accused the security agencies, particularly the police of playing double standard game when the electorate were being attacked by thugs during the presidential election, Ibadin said such occurrences were in isolated cases as the security agencies largely displayed professionalism at most polling units across the federation.

He blamed members of the political class, who over the years, have under-provided for the needs of the security agencies particularly the police, which has the responsibility for internal security. He charged the government to improve the welfare package of the police in other to stem the tide of unprofessional conduct at all times. Ibadin advised members of the judiciary to uphold the sanctity and oath of the office they occupy, reminding the judges of the already questionable image of Nigeria’s judiciary and advised them not to compromise their integrity. “Judges should know that the judiciary has always been regarded as the last hope of the common man and must do everything to uphold such ethos by not indulging in any filthy lucre capable of destroying their career and the judiciary as an institution,” he advised.

The private security consultant has also advised the President-elect, Tinubu to extend his hand of fellowship, as promised in his acceptance speech, to the PDP and Labour Party candidates, Atiku Abubakar and Peter Obi respectively for making the election a keenly contested one and collaborating to build a better Nigeria. Similarly, he urged Atiku and Obi to always remember the sportsmanship displayed by former President Goodluck Jonathan in accepting defeat as a sitting president in the 2015 presidential election just like the case of President Donald Trump of United States of America who lost to Joe Biden two years ago in the greater interest of their countries. While appreciating President Muhammadu Buhari for conducting election to choose a successor come May 29, 2023, Ibadin also appealed to politicians not to play into the hands of enemies from foreign countries who do not wish Nigeria well by causing chaos that may lead to destruction of public infrastructures. He contended that election should not be seen as a do or die affair pointing out that even Buhari lost the presidential contest three times before he eventually won in 2015.
