The European Union (EU) has kicked off the second phase of its Import Control System 2 (ICS2), to guide modalities of air shipments into the member States. ICS2, being a new advanced cargo information and risk management platform, aims to protect against security and safety threats from goods entering the EU. The enforcement, which took-off March 1, 2023, requires of all air carriers, freight forwarders, express couriers, and postal operators involved in the transportation of goods by air to or through the EU to provide a complete set of Entry Summary Declaration data on the goods, prior to their arrival at the EU external border. According to the Commission of Tax and Customs, inbound freights must be done through the ICS2 system, which is gradually replacing the EU’s existing Import Control System (ICS) between 2021 and 2024. “Air carriers currently filing advance cargo information into the Import Control System (ICS) will fully phase out from that system as soon as they start filing this data into ICS2,” the Commission stated. The second phase of ICS2 introduces new data requirements and processes to be complied with, prior to transporting the goods from a third country and before their arrival at the European Union’s external border. Failure by affected economic operators to obtain the necessary data from their clients and to provide it to ICS2 will lead to actions by customs authorities to enforce compliance prior to and on arrival at the external border.
