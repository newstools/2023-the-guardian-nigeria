Rainstorm has wreaked havoc in Oke-Ako community in Ikole Local Council of Ekiti State and destroyed over 105 buildings. The Friday evening torrential downpour, which lasted for over two hours, also destroyed some electricity facilities across the town, thereby subjecting residents to total blackout. Speaking during an on-the-spot assessment of the level of destruction, Ekiti State governor, Mr. Biodun Oyebanji, expressed sympathy for the residents. Oyebanji, represented by his Deputy, Chief (Mrs.) Monisade Afuye, described the incident as devastating. The Deputy Governor was conducted round the affected areas by the Regent of the town, Her Royal Highness Ogunbiyi Tinuade Adebayo, the lawmaker representing Ikole Constituency 2, Hon Adeoye Aribasoye and the Chairman, Ajoni Local Council Development Area (LCDA), Mr. Michael Ogungbemi. A statement by Special Assistant (Media) to the Deputy Governor, Victor Ogunje, quoted the Governor as expressing delight that no life was lost during the stormy rainfall. “On behalf of Governor Biodun Oyebanji, I  sympathise with you on the destruction caused by rainstorm to many residential buildings and electricity poles in this town , which we believe must have affected the wellbeing of the victims. “Information at our disposal and on- the- spot assessment revealed   that roofs of scores of residential buildings and electricity facilities  were destroyed during the stormy rainfall, thereby rendering many homeless and helpless. “We sympathise with the victims at this trying time and plead for calmness, in the sense that a natural disaster of this nature is  one occurrence that is difficult to control. But with personal precautions and right efforts, its effects can be minimised.”
