• Zaka: Make N200 our highest denomination A week after the Supreme Court delivered its final ruling in the lawsuit on the old banknotes and extended their validity to December 31, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is yet to formally give a directive to deposit money banks (DMBs), stoking confusion over the status of the contentious N500 and N1,000 notes.  Meanwhile, former president, Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN), Mazi Okechukwu Unegbu, has tasked CBN to comply with the ruling of the Supreme Court that the old notes should remain legal tender till December 31. He also asked banks to start re-circulating the deposited notes. According to him, “there is nothing CBN can do with the decision of the Supreme Court other than to obey and allow the re-circulation of old notes. “If CBN refuses to comply with the Supreme Court now, then we will have to wait till May 29 when the new government will take over power to instruct the apex bank to reverse the decision on the naira issue.”
ON his part, a public affairs analyst, Bala Zaka, has implored CBN to use the opportunity of this cash squeeze to make N200 the nation’s highest denomination. According to him, considering the micro and macroeconomic activities interplay, he suggested, “this is the best time to withdraw the N1,000 and N500 bills out of circulation because we honestly don’t need them. “We should use this opportunity to make N200 our highest denomination and that will help in deepening the cashless policy and even reduce crime, because if you analyse it critically, you will agree with me that kidnapping for liquid cash ransom by bandits and criminals has really gone down. Ransoms paid through banks and other electronic media can easily be traced and the criminal hunted and smoked out.” He added that more N200 and lower bills should be pumped into circulation.
