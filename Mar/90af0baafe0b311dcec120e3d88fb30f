A Nigerian soldier, Lance Corporal Nwobodo Chinonso, has killed the Commander of the Forward Operating Base (FOB), Rabah in Sokoto State, and three other colleagues before committing suicide.  After killing his colleagues, the shooter turned the gun to himself and committed suicide.
The remains of the victims have reportedly been moved to the Usmanu Danfodiyo Teaching Hospital (UDUTH), Sokoto, while investigation has commenced.
  
A senior officer in Sokoto Division told PR Nigeria that the soldier might have been battling “operational and psychological stress”.
“It is something that is common in the military. But that’s not a justification for any of our soldiers to go haywire,” he said.
