The Gubernatorial candidate of the Accord Party, Hakeem Dickson, has said he would run an inclusive and transformational leadership if elected into office as Lagos State governor. Addressing journalists in the state, Dickson promised to raise the standard of Lagos to the status of a mega city. Dickson, who noted that his administration would also engage youths in physical and intellectual activities, explained that if he wins, he intends to establish factories and more skill acquisition centres that would be accessible to both the educated and illiterates. He said he would also establish aeronautical engineering centres, phone building and assembling centres and automobile centres. He also revealed he intends to work closely with banks to facilitate student loans, adding, “we’ll coordinate support to finance budding entrepreneurs through those vocational centres.” Dickson said that with his vast experience as a local government chairman and an active community development advocate, he can take Lagos to the promise land. Born on May 5, 1957, Dickson is an Awori prince from Itireland and the Onikoyi kingdom. He attended Breadfruit Primary School on Lagos Island. He earned a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from Thomas A. Edison State College in Trenton, New Jersey, and two master’s degrees in Business Administration, specialising in Accounting and Finance, from Fairleigh Dickinson University in Rutherford, New Jersey, in 1983 and 1985 respectively.
