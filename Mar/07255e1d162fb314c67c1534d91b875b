PHANTOM V Fold offers a 120Hz flagship dual screen, and a powerful 5-lens photography system for an unparalleled crease-free large-screen experience. Yesterday, TECNO’s premium sub-brand, PHANTOM, launched a new flagship smartphone, the PHANTOM V Fold, marking the brand’s emphatic entrance into the foldable device market. The phone delivers an immersive visual experience through an optimally sized flagship dual screen and an ultra-clear 5-lens photography system for unparalleled image-making. Launched during TECNO’s debut appearance at MWC Barcelona 2023, PHANTOM V Fold is the latest innovation from the brand as it continues to revolutionize the premium smartphone experience through outstanding technologies and exceptional performance. Two Flagship Screens Create New Possibilities
Empowering users to discover greater smartphone fluency, whether gaming, watching movies, or at work, PHANTOM V Fold’s flagship dual LTPO screens have an adaptive 10-120Hz high refresh rate, delivering smooth motions and fluid transitions both when folded and unfolded.
The phone’s 6.42-inch sub-screen has a unique micro-curved design and a 21:9 aspect ratio for a classic single-screen flagship smartphone experience. The result of extensive research into usage scenarios and global smartphone use, the sub-screen dimensions are optimal for single-handed operation, sitting naturally in the palm while allowing the users to comfortably take command using just a thumb. Unfolded, PHANTOM V Fold reveals an outstanding 7.85-inch display with an optimal 8:7 aspect ratio on an ultra-flat screen with a virtually invisible crease. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2016250 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/TECNO-2.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/TECNO-2.jpg 1280w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/TECNO-2-1062x598.jpg 1062w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/TECNO-2-640x360.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/TECNO-2-320x180.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/TECNO-2-278x156.jpg 278w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/TECNO-2-556x312.jpg 556w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/TECNO-2-515x290.jpg 515w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/TECNO-2-1030x580.jpg 1030w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/TECNO-2-712x401.jpg 712w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/TECNO-2-1424x802.jpg 1424w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/TECNO-2-600x338.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" />
PHANTOM V Fold’s 7.85-inch screen creates an immersive viewing experience. TECNO’s Technologies Inspire an Almost-Invisible Screen Crease 
PHANTOM V Fold’s main inner screen is enhanced by TECNO’s continuous pursuit of the next best technologies. The brand’s self-developed, aerospace-grade drop-shaped hinge creates a virtually crease-free ultra-flat main inner screen surface. The hinge’s innovative reverse snap structure significantly improves the phone’s structural stability, while its aerospace-grade construction materials create strength with a lightweight.
The self-developed fixed-axis rotation and slide technology hinge design ensure PHANTOM V Fold’s main inner screen fits tightly together, ultimately delivering an almost unnoticeable crease. When new, the device’s screen crease measures just 0.11mm, and the device is capable of 200,000 folds.

Five Lenses for Unprecedented Image-Making
PHANTOM V Fold’s ultra-clear 5-lens photography system creates an unprecedented image-making experience with lenses for various uses. With three rear lenses and two front lenses, users can explore the world through new lenses. Enabling spectacular nighttime image making, PHANTOM V Fold’s 50MP Super Night main camera features a super light-sensitive custom 1/1.3-inch sensor, large f/1.85 aperture, and 7P composition. The phone’s night imaging capabilities are further enhanced by AI-powered Super Night Portrait, Super Night Mode, and Super Night 4K Video, which reduce noise and capture crisp lines to make the night come alive in exquisite detail. The other rear lenses are a powerful 50MP telephoto lens with 2x optical and 20x digital zoom and a 13MP ultra wide-angle lens. In addition to the rear lenses, two additional front lenses – one on the sub-screen and one on the main inner screen – bring more fun to photography with exciting image-making possibilities. While rear lenses can now be easily used for high-quality selfies, the foldable screen design allows for large-screen image capturing with a preview displayed to the subjects on the sub-screen. In contrast, the front camera on the main inner screen enhances video calling and conferencing. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2016252 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/TECNO-4.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/TECNO-4.jpg 1280w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/TECNO-4-1062x598.jpg 1062w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/TECNO-4-640x360.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/TECNO-4-320x180.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/TECNO-4-278x156.jpg 278w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/TECNO-4-556x312.jpg 556w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/TECNO-4-515x290.jpg 515w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/TECNO-4-1030x580.jpg 1030w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/TECNO-4-712x401.jpg 712w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/TECNO-4-1424x802.jpg 1424w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/TECNO-4-600x338.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" />

Though the large-screen foldable smartphone experience has much to offer, it has often needed to be improved by having operating systems unsuitable for the devices. As a result, TECNO developed HiOS13 Fold – a highly optimized and customized operating system based on Google’s Android 13, specially designed for a foldable device. Large-screen capabilities such as split screens, picture-in-picture, parallel windows, and drag and drop across screens, as well as differentiated interactive animation designs, create a system that empowers users’ productivity and overall enjoyment. Foldable customizations have been made to the top 1,000 apps with the highest download frequency globally, of which 90% have been adapted to support split-screen and multi-window modes. In total, over 2000 apps have been adapted for HiOS13 Fold.
