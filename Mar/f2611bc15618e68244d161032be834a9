NIN verification to cost N1,000, $5, $15 The National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) has agreed on a framework with the Nigerian Immigration Service (NIS) to improve the quality of service, accuracy and speed of passport services through the timely verification of the National Identification Number (NIN). In a statement, yesterday, signed by its Head, Corporate Communications, Kayode Adegoke, NIMC noted that the new arrangement was in furtherance of the Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economyâ€™s directive to streamline passport application, renewal and issuance processes. Consequently, a NIN Verification fee would be charged for each Nigerian passport application for this service. According to him, in Nigeria, applicable NIN verification fee would be N1,000; African countries $5 (or its equivalent in other currencies) and other countries would be $15 (or its equivalent in other countries). Adegoke said NIMC and NIS agreed on a revised applicant journey that would significantly improve the speed of passport issuance/re-issuance and reduce the traffic at NIS office(s). According to him, the NIN service, fees and the new NIS process will start on April 1, 2023. MEANWHILE, NIN issued by NIMC increased by 1.5 million in February, as the figure rose from 95 million in January to 96.5 million.
