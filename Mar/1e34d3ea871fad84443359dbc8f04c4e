Tracking Tinubu’s chequered battles
Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu was in the early hours of March 1, 2023 returned as the winner of the presidential poll held on Saturday February 25. That brought to fruition the former Lagos State governor’s life-long journey to preside over the affairs of Nigeria.
   
The final phase of the journey actually began on Monday January 10, 2022. On that fateful day, Tinubu had visited President Muhammadu Buhari at the State House, Presidential Villa and both men retreated to a closed-door meeting.
