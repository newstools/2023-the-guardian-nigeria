Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA) has advised those aggrieved by outcome of the presidential election to seek redress in court. The group, which decried handling of the exercise and the eventual outcome in a statement, yesterday, by its National Coordinator, Comrade Emmanuel Onwubiko, charged the judiciary to be independent in its dealings. HURIWA noted: “It is undemocratic, irrational, irresponsible and insensitive for anyone to expect that those candidates allegedly robbed of victory by Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) would just swallow the perceived injustice and unfairness hook, line and sinker and then fail to exhaust their constitutionally allowed right to seek judicial intervention to remedy the perceived failings of INEC in the courts of competent jurisdiction in compliance with Section 6 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended).”
