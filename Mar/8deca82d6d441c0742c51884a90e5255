Speaking during a news conference at Ikota, the Chairman of Eti-Osa Baale Forum, Chief Wasiu Ali-Balogun, said that Sanwo-Olu had been fulfilling his promises to residents of Lagos state, hence, the “Baales” supported his re-election for 2nd term in office. Ali-Balogun said that there were lots of irregularities during the Feb. 25 Presidential Election, adding that security would be beefed up to ensure safety during the Governorship Election. He, therefore, urged residents of Eti-Osa to put behind the outcome of the Presidential Election, and come out en masse to vote the All Progressives Congress candidates. ”Our incumbent governor is the governor of all the people, anointed governor, reliable and responsible, hardworking, a listening governor. ”We are solidly behind the governor, the present administration up to the federal level. ”With what happened during the presidential election, there are a lot of irregularities but we just need to come and correct the impression. “Elections will come and elections will go, but Eti-Osa Baale Forum will remain one. ”Our governor has done a lot of marvelous jobs that we can easily point to. When we have anything that concerns us particularly the Baales, I can say that he gives  good recognition to the Baales in the whole of Lagos State. ”We called this meeting to advise that those who might be annoyed with the outcome of the last election should forget. ”Let’s forget the past and face the future, because the only thing that we need to do is to appeal to them to forget what anyone did during the past elections mainly because of Gov.Sanwo-Olu,” Ali-Balogun said.
