Download logo Today, 07 March 2023, South Africa joints other countries in marking the Indian Ocean RIM Association (IORA) Day. IORA Day is aimed at highlighting the importance of the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) and the inextricable link to the continent through African countries of Southern and Eastern Africa bordering the Indian Ocean, the critical importance of Africa’s seas and oceans and the role of the Association in fostering and promoting peace, security, cooperation and socio-economic development in the IOR.  The theme for the commemoration event is: “AU Decade of the Oceans 2015 – 2025: Intensifying Collaboration between IORA and the AU for the next 25 Years”.  IORA continues to focus on the six priority areas of the Concord which were adopted by the IORA Leaders in Jakarta, Indonesia, as an outcome of the Summit in 2014. These are: maritime safety and security; trade and investment facilitation; fisheries management; disaster risk reduction; academic and science and technology cooperation; and tourism promotion and cultural exchange. The ocean economy and women empowerment are agreed priorities that cut across the six priorities.  South Africa is hard at work in ensuring that, within IORA, we achieve the Sustainable Development Goal 14: which is sustainable use of the oceans, which will help in creating sustainable jobs in the industry while working to ensure long-term conservation.  Additionally, the event is aimed at publicising the IORA and the envisioned strengthening of collaboration with the African Union (AU) during the declared AU’s Decade of the Seas and Oceans period.
