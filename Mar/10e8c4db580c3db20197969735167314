The Federal Polytechnic Nekede, Owerri, has got the Federal Government’s nod for a second campus in Egbema, Ohaji/Egbema Council, Imo State. Rector of the institution, Dr. Michael Arimanwa, said President Muhammadu Buhari granted the approval in a letter dated January 12, 2023. According to the rector, the second campus is a finished project with state-of-the-art facilities, and was originally built as a modern skill acquisition centre by the Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs. Following a tour of the facility recently by a joint team of officials from the Ministry of Niger Delta and the polytechnic management, The Guardian observed that the campus boasts of modern classrooms, workshops, hostels, staff quarters, auditorium and sports complex, among others. Arimanwa said: “The second campus is expected to contribute to the expansion of the institution. Ultimately, it is expected to accommodate disciplines that are over 80 per cent practical oriented. The formal handover ceremony of the second campus is expected to be performed by President Buhari. The need for a new site has been on the front burner for sometime, prompting the rector to swing into action on how to solve the problem. There are disciplines in the institution, which simply require demonstration sites. For instance, all the disciplines in the School of Agricultural Technology require demonstration farms, in line with the standards of the National Board for Technical Education (NBTE).
