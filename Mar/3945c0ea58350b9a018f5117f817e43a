The deceased, whose identities could not be ascertained at the time of filing this report were riding on a wine colour Bajaj motorcycle, MUN957QA, also known as okada, and were rammed into by a lemon green Toyota Camry car with registration number LEM568TK, which was on high speed. The incident led to a spontaneous protest by residents of the community as they expressed their grievances over frequent accidents and high fatality rate in the area recently. The Kwara State Sector Commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Frederick Ade Ogidan, confirmed the incident. He said the two occupants of the Toyota Camry were injured while the man and his son were later confirmed dead at the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital (UITH), Ilorin. “The Command is looking at putting some rumbling stripes along the road to reduce speed because bumps would worsen the situation. “We have succeeded in calming the protesting youths and advised them to always use helmet when riding Okada and look very well before entering the road”, he added.
