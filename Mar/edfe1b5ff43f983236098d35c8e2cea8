Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, has said Labour Party (LP) won presidential election in his state because he allowed a free and fair election, where every voter exercised their rights to vote candidates of their choice, unlike what happened in some states, where such rights were denied. Okowa, who briefed journalists after commissioning Government House Press Centre, also said Obidient movement were fired by three forces, namely: the need to ensure that a southern president emerged, to disallow a Muslim-Muslim ticket, and to enthrone an Igbo presidency that have been denied them. He said: “The important thing is that they achieved this victory because people were allowed to exercise their rights to vote for candidates of their choice in Delta State.” On former Governor James Ibori, a PDP stalwart, allegedly supporting APC governorship candidate, Ovie Omo-Agege, Okowa said Ibori was free to support candidate of his choice. He said he does not want to dwell too much on the issue, as he is a true democrat, who understands that people have the right to their choice. He said the PDP governorship candidate, Sheriff Oborevwore, is a product of a free and fair democratic primary process and those opposing his candidature are undemocratic forces. “In the primary, one person scored 590 votes while the second person scored 113 votes. Are you saying it’s a wrong choice? “I am once a product of a democratic process. I went through that process in 2015, I thank God that the process was democratic, I thank the former governor for ensuring a democratic primary process even though his preferred candidate did not emerge,” Okowa said. The governor described as false, the rumour making the round that he was in the process of taking a fresh  N850 billion loan, describing it as the handiwork of the opposition APC.
