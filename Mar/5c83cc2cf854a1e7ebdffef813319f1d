Martin Bakole has compared Anthony Joshua’s power to that of Oleksandr Usyk, and believes Joshua’s punches are of a whole different magnitude to Usyk’s, writes boxing-social.com. Bakole has sparred plenty of rounds with both men, so, there are perhaps, few better placed to make the assessment than the Congolese contender. And in an interview with IFL TV, Bakole talked of the “big difference” in power between Joshua and Usyk. “I don’t think he [Usyk] has the same power as ‘AJ.’ I think that ‘AJ’ has more power than him. When I sparred him, I never felt a big punch like I did when I sparred Joshua – there was a big difference. “But boxing is not just about having a big punch, it’s about skill as well,” he said. Fans will hope they are reintroduced to Joshua’s famed power in his comeback fight against Jermaine Franklin, which holds at the 02 Arena on April 1. Following back to back distance losses to Usyk, many feel ‘AJ’ needs to go out and make a destructive statement when he faces Franklin, who narrowly lost out to former Joshua foe, Dillian Whyte, back in November. Bakole may not be a million miles off a headgear free meeting with Joshua or Usyk, having stopped Tony Yoka last time out in what was a career best win, against the bookmakers’ odds. Boxxer recently announced a multi fight deal with the Scotland-based heavyweight, so fights with new stablemates, Joseph Parker and Frazer Clarke, are perhaps more likely in the short term. Ranked #2 with the WBA, Bakole’s trainer, Billy Nelson, has incessantly called for a fight with Daniel Dubois, who currently holds the governing body’s ‘regular’ title.
