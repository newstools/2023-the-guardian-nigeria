Big brother always has a way of spicing up the game and bringing exciting and shocking developments. Weeks after big brother made the rule that the housemates would play the same in pairs, he finally announced that the pair had been dissolved. The Big Brother Titans housemates will now play the game as individuals until the very end. Ipeleng, one of the female South African housemates, has yet again won the head of house game. Ipeleng and her former partner, Blaqboi won the head of house challenge in the second week. In week eight, Ipeleng emerged as the winner of the HoH game and won the ultimate veto power, which automatically earned her a spot in the finale. In big brother’s house, it’s big brother’s rules.

Nollywood actress Omotola Jalade revealed how broken she was after her dad died when she was only 12 years old during her interview with Chude Jideonwo, a Nigerian filmmaker. She also stated that she might have been a prostitute after her dad’s death. “I think everything that have been today, positively or negatively, was because of the death of my father; it affected me so much because I did not mourn my dad. I understand that I was his only child for a long time, and my dad and I were very close. He was the manager of Lagos Country Club at the time, and many influential people come there, and because of that, I started rolling with people of influence from a little age. When I was 13, they came to pick me up from school. I knew something was wrong and prayed that hope nothing has happened to my dad. When I got home, I realised my dad was dead, so going through that mental process, I didn’t know how to react and I didn’t know how I was feeling; I was just silent. But now that I’m older, I think I really understand everything. So I just became emotionless, and it has affected me till today. There is nothing anyone says to me that can move me; I am so confident in who I am and I don’t fear anyone. I don’t fear for my life; probably I would have become a prostitute today. I was very desperate to do anything and said I would rather sell my body than for anybody to take my younger brother apart.”
