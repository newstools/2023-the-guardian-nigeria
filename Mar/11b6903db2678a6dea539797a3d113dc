Suspected fighters of the Islamic State West African Province (ISWAP) have reportedly killed 26 fishermen in an attack in Mukdolo village, Gamborun Ngala, Borno state. A report by Zagazola Makama said the ISWAP fighters ambushed, tortured, and killed the fishermen on Wednesday, March 8, 2023. The publication, according to military sources, said that dozens of terrorists on motorcycles invaded Mukdolo village and shot sporadically. The sources further disclosed that at least nine of the fishermen managed to escape from the scene while three sustained bullet wounds. The gunmen thereafter reportedly surrounded those who were unable to escape, subsequently torturing and killing them. “They asked them to lay down. Thereafter, they used their fishing net and wrapped it around them before they started torturing them. ” “After they became unconscious, they opened fire at them, killing them instantly,” a source told Zagazola Makama.” The bodies of the 26 fishermen were later recovered during a search and rescue operation by troops. The attack comes just one week after the troops of operation Hadin Kai intercepted and killed a commander of the jihadists and some of his fighters in Mukdolo.
