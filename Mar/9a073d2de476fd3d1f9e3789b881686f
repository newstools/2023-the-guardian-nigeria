Adara Development Association (ADA) has denied endorsing the gubernatorial candidate of All Progressives Congress (APC), Sen. Uba Sani, for Kaduna State. The Adara people said the ADA leadership made no such endorsement as purported in an online medium. In a statement signed by ADA National Secretary General, Luke Waziri; Kaduna chapter Secretary, Everest Gideon; and Rev. Dogara Nathan, yesterday, the people resolved to pursue with vigour, commitment, honesty and brotherhood their collective interest. A son of Adara, Dr. Sani Mazawaje, is the running mate to the governorship candidate of New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), Sen. Suleiman Hunkuyi. The statement reads: “The Adara people under the able leadership of Kaduna ADA chapter and the National leadership reinstate, affirm and resolved to put before the public domain that no such endorsement was made, by part or whole of the ADA leadership, of any gubernatorial candidate as purported by an online publication of March 8, 2023. Therefore, it is hereby refuted in its entirety. “We, therefore, agree to continue to work assiduously for the common good of our people today and forever.”
