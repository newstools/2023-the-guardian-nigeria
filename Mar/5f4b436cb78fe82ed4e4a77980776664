Over 5, 500 supporters of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and African Democratic Congress (ADC) have defected to the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Yobe State. The massive defection from the two parties was targeting at ensuring the re-elect bid of Governor Mai Mala Buni in the forthcoming elections. While receiving the defectors, yesterday, in Damaturu, the APC State Chairman, Mohammed Gadaka, disclosed that the defectors from PDP and ADC, including the leading defectors are from the Nayi/Nawa ward of Damaturu, the state capital. According to him, the massive defection of parties’ supporters, led by Sale Adamu of the PDP, Hamza Isa Adamu and Mohammed Ahmed Babandi of the ADC, will ensure the sweeping of the March 18, 2023 Governorship and House of Assembly polls. Gadaka, who said he was delighted to witness the massive defection, noted that: “All the defectors to our ruling party would be accorded equal rights with the common goals of unity to deliver the dividends of democracy in the state. “Our party will carry the new members along in its activities,” stating that other political parties in the state are to also join APC in moving the state forward. He therefore, urged the new members to rally round the party manifestos, policies and programmes for the state’s economic growth and development. “We will support you, vote and return you for the second term to continue doing the good work to the people of Yobe State,” said Adamu.
