Isn’t it surprising amidst the troubles in Ukraine the president still got time to for music? Well, here’s a little talk about his feature with popular pop star Brad Paisley. Volodymyr Zelensky appears on Billboard’s charts, thanks to his feature on Brad Paisley‘s new single. The song titled ‘Same Here’ hit the waves with over 5000 downloads, as well as making it into the all genre Digital Song Sales for the year. This is according to Luminates. Featuring a spoken section from Zelenskyy, the song which benefited United 24, a charitable program to restore Ukrainian homes destroyed during the on-going Russian invasion (which began Feb. 24, 2022, a year to the day before the song’s release). Zelenskiy still had time to make his country’s people feel good. This isn’t the very first time Presidents of nations would do similar things, with the likes of Ronald Reagan, Obama, and even john f. Kennedy all at one time doing music too.
The track, Paisley’s co-written first release on Universal Music Group Nashville’s EMI Nashville Records, also begins on country digital song sales at No. 3. Speaking to the media Paisley said, “The label was so great about it, realizing this isn’t going to be the feel-good hit of the year and this isn’t going to be something that’s going to work long-term at radio, not going to research,” noting that there will not be a radio edit without Zelenskyy. “I thought, ‘Would President Zelenskyy like to have the last couple of minutes and have a discussion with me on the ways we’re the same?’ This needs to exist in whatever form we can present it.” Moving on, he has to attend to the latest massive drone strikes from Russia on his home. What a man Zelenskyy has become overtime.
