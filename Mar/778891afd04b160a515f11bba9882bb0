Ekiti State Governor, Biodun Oyebanji, yesterday, said that his administration would begin comprehensive renovation of government hospitals. The governor said this when he paid an unscheduled visit to General Hospital in Ilawe-Ekiti, saying that the decision to embark on the renovation of all health facilities was to ensure effective healthcare delivery system in the state. Oyebanji, who was conducted round the hospital complex by the Chief Medical Director, Dr. Oladimeji Ashafa, expressed dissatisfaction with the current state of Ilawe hospital. He, however, said he was happy that he came to see the situation by himself, adding that regular inspection of facilities and projects across the state would be a major feature of his administration. He, therefore, urged workers in the hospital not to be discouraged by the physical structure, assuring them that the hospital will be captured in the next phase of hospital renovation project, which he said, was being done in phases. The governor also called on prominent Ekiti indigenes to contribute their quotas in ensuring the well-being of government facilities in their localities. Oyebanji, who made a personal donation of a 7.5kva generating set to the hospital to boost its services and bring about effective service delivery, assured that the hospital would get a facelift very soon, as it was bound to be captured in the subsequent phase of hospital renovation exercise. He commended members of staff of the hospital for their perseverance, commitment and dedication to duty in spite of the challenges of dilapidated facilities and structures in the hospital. Besides, the governor assured the people that the road from Ilawe-Ekiti to Ikere-Ekiti would be revisited, as his government has begun the process to mobilise contractors handling the project to site.
