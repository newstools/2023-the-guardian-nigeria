The Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN) says it is not aware of any track and field competition purportedly scheduled to hold between March 17 and 18 at the Ahmadu Bello University sports ground, Zaria, Kaduna State.  “We hereby make it known to all athletes that intend to participate in the competition not to be deceived by the logos as a sign of approval from AFN. We also use this opportunity to inform all that, henceforth, any competition that did not follow due process will no longer count nor be used as a selection criterion for any international events by AFN as embedded in the selection rules.” The AFN advised intending competition organisers to follow due process before holding any athletics competition to achieve the desired mutual purpose of developing the sport in Nigeria.
