Unity Bank Plc has announced the launch of the Unity Bank Women Network to foster greater inclusion, equity and opportunities aimed at promoting gender empowerment. While announcing the commencement of the initiative in Lagos, the Managing Director of Unity Bank Plc, Tomi Somefun, said: “As women, we must also do our part to create a more equitable society that empowers women, drives them to do more, entrust them with responsibilities and celebrate their achievements every step of the way.” Unity Bank Women’s Network is conceptualised as a gender advocacy platform to enable the bank to target and champion initiatives to promote networking and relationships beginning with females within the institution. The initiative will provide mentorship opportunities and advocacy on social and other relevant issues such as gender equality, parenting, financial education and leadership. While naming the Bank’s Chief Compliance Officer, Patricia Ahunanya, as the coordinator of the network, Somefun said “I believe this network will promote more visibility, inclusion, and collaboration amongst women within our organisation.” Speaking further on this year’s IWD theme, ‘Embrace Equity’, Somefun said the day provided an opportunity to reflect on the ongoing advocacy for gender equality, adding that Unity Bank would continue to create an enabling and equitable environment that focused on empowering its female workforce by creating an atmosphere in which women can thrive, irrespective of culture, background and education.”
