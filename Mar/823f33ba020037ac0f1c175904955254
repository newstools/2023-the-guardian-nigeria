Delta State Police Command has warned those circulating some video clips shown on various social media platforms about protests in Warri and Asaba to desist from it or face the wrath of law. Spokesperson for the Command, Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), Bright Edafe, in a statement made available to newsmen, in Asaba, yesterday, said: “The video clip is not only false but completely misleading with the intention of creating panic in the state, which has been generally peaceful since the commencement of the 2023 general elections. “Investigation has further revealed that the video clip is suspected to be an old video and, as such, should be completely disregarded. “To this end, the Election Commissioner of Police, John Babangida, therefore advises the public to not only ignore the video clip, but desist from circulating such old video clips. The state is currently peaceful and calm, and the Command will do all within its powers to see that it remains so.”
