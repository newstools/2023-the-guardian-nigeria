Commuters left stranded for hours A police officer identified simply as Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP) Agaga, attached to Ughelli Area Command in Delta State, yesterday, allegedly victimised and detained a transporter, one Mr. Friday Okotoko, after a scuffle at Matrix filling station along the East-West Road, Ughelli.  The incident reportedly started at about 9:14a.m.,  but the passengers did not leave Ughelli Area Command until 1:45p.m. Contacted, spokesperson for Delta State Police Command, Bright Edafe said: “The policeman wanted to come out while the driver was behind him; he honked for him, but he never allowed him to leave. He came down and showed him his ID card that he was a policeman and needed to leave, but the driver came out to push the CSP to the ground and started punching him.
   
“It was the policeman posted to that station that saw what was happening and arrested the driver and detained him.	 
 
“The CSP is not even serving in the Command, he should be one of those posted on election duty. The thing happened today (yesterday) at about 2:00p.m.  I assure you that the  driver will be charged to court  today (Thursday).”
