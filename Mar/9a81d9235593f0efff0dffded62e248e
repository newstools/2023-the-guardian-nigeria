Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) senatorial candidate for Ogun Central, Chief Olumide Aderinokun, has rejected the result of last Saturday’s presidential and National Assembly elections in Ogun State, alleging over-voting and other electoral malpractices.
 
Aderinokun, who was announced runner-up in the senatorial election behind Afolabi Salisu of the All Progressives Congress (APC), alleged that over 100 polling units in the district recorded over-voting.
 
Speaking through his media aide, Taiye Taiwo, he faulted results declared by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), saying he would challenge it in court. He said: “The good people of Ogun Central have been robbed. The system failed the people, and Aderinokun with the backing of the PDP family in Ogun will not accept it.
 
“The result will be challenged because it doesn’t reflect the will of the people in Ogun Central. There were many instances of over-voting, poor network for the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) to work effectively, delayed uploading of results and there were inconsistencies with numbers of voters and the results.”
 
INEC had announced late last Sunday that Aderinokun polled 52,940 while APC’s Salisu got 96,769 votes with Collins Abayomi  of Labour Party (LP) in third position with 27,884 votes.
