KAA Gent have slapped a €50million price-tag on Gift Orban who made history by becoming the first player ever to score four goals in a Belgian Jupiler Pro League match for the club. Orban scored as many as four goals in a Belgian Pro League game on Sunday night to help Gent hammer Zulte Waregem 6-2 at the Elindus Arena. Prior to the trip to Zulte Waregem, the Nigerian striker had never scored a hat-trick in his professional career. The 20-year-old’s four-goal haul came in a 30-minute spell in the second half. He netted his first goal of the game in the 53rd minute, grabbed his brace in the 68th minute and then, his first career hat-trick in the 75th minute before wrapping up the scoring in the 83rd minute. Orban just joined Gent from Norwegian club, Stabaek Fotbal in January for €3.3m but he has taken the Belgian Jupiler Pro League by storm. And as a result of his goal-scoring heroics for the club, Gent have now slapped a staggering €50m price-tag on the Nigerian striker. Orban, meanwhile, has his sights set on securing a transfer to the English Premier League in future. “Left or right, I don’t care. Especially the victory is very important,” Orban said post-match, according to Gent’s official website. “My level has to be even higher if I ever want to play in the Premier League. There is still a lot of work to be done.” On becoming the first player from Gent to score four goals in a single Belgian First Division A game this century, he said he is expecting more. “Don’t look at that. I play my matches and score my goals. You never know, that’s football,” he added. Orban has been in top form since his transfer to Gent and has now scored nine goals in eight appearances across all competitions. Last week Thursday, Orban was also on target with his goal helping Gent to secure a 1-1 draw with Istanbul Basaksehir in the first leg of their UEFA Europa Conference League last-16 tie.
