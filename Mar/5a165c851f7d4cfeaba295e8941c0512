The Nigerian Naval Headquarters (NHQ), Abuja, has confirmed arrest and detention of Ratings, who invaded a police station in Warri, Delta State, beating up a police sergeant and causing pandemonium. Navy spokesman, Commodre Ayo Vaughan, who confirmed the arrest, said: “The personnel have been arrested and detained for quick investigation and strict disciplinary action.” Personnel of the Nigerian Navy ship, NNS Delta, on Friday, allegedly invaded the Enerhen Divisional Police Station in Uvwie Local Council to beat up a police sergeant, simply identified as Kingsley. The incident, which occurred around 7.30a.m., caused pandemonium, as the area was rocked by sporadic gunshots, forcing owners of commercial shops to quickly shut down, while residents taking their children to schools or going to work, scampered for safety. It was learnt that a newly commissioned officer attached to the NNS Delta in Warri allegedly led other officers to the police station to set free a colleague earlier arrested by policemen.
