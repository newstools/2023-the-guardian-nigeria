Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), will today, embark on a street protest against conduct and outcome of the presidential election. The march is to end at Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) headquarters in Abuja as early as 10.00a.m. The main opposition party, had on Friday, rejected declaration of All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate, Bola Tinubu, as President-elect by the electoral umpire. It demanded that INEC should immediately withdraw the Certificate of Return (CoR) issued to the former Lagos State governor and cancel the poll in line deference to Section 65 of the Electoral Act 2022. The party insisted that the electoral body, in declaring the APC flag-bearer as winner of contest, acted contrary to provisions of the 1999 Constitution (as amended), Electoral Act 2022 and guidelines and regulations for conduct of the 2023 presidential election. PDP claimed that its standard-bearer, Atiku Abubakar, “clearly won the February 25, 2023 presidential election, having evidently scored the majority of lawful votes cast by Nigerians at the polling units.” It equally held that the exercise was marred by “deliberate malpractices, including the non-use of Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) and INEC’s refusal/failure to transmit directly results from polling units to its server/website in flagrant violation of Section 60 (4)(b) of the Electoral Act 2022.” The party added: “This violation of the Electoral Act by INEC, as attested to by political parties, voters, Nigerians of all walks of life, as well as local and International observers, paved way for alteration, falsification, switching of results and allocation of figures in favour of the APC.”
