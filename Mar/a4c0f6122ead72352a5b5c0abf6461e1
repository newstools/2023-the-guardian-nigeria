As I hold this certificate, this moment is one of celebration and gladness for us. The road has been long. Yet, we walked it. The battle has been hard fought. Yet, we won it.  Where there is hunger. Let us feed the people, chasinghunger from their midst. Where there is now scarcity, let us rediscover abundance. Where there is brutality, may we replace it with brotherhood.
 
Where violence stalks the land, may we establish peace. Where others have erected temples to hatred and bias, may we construct permanent monuments to compassion and abiding affection. 
History will record this day as the moment when I officially stood before you as president elect.
 
However, I would like to dedicate this day and record it as the moment that we vowed to come together to make Nigeria stand and shine forth at the beloved and brave republic God intended it to be.Speech delivered by the President-elect, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu after collecting his certificate of return from Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Abuja, yesterday.
