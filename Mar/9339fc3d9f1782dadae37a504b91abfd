The Nigerian government has revoked the work permit, visa, and residence permit of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Seplat Energy Plc, Roger Brown. Minister of Internal Affairs, Rauf Aregbesola, communicated this to the Board Chairman of Seplat Energy Plc accusing Brown of allegations of racism, and discrimination against Nigerian employees and others. “I write to inform you that the Ministry is in receipt of a petition from the Solicitor to the concerned workers and stakeholders of Seplat Energy PLC accusing Mr. Rogers Thomson Brown, the CEO of the companies, of various allegations,” Aregbesola said. “These accusations include racism, favouring foreign workers, and discriminating against Nigerian employees. Testimony was received from several witnesses, which supported the allegations.” The minister accused Brown of being in possession of a Combined Expatriate Residence Permit and Aliens Card (CERPAC) not based on a valid expatriate quota that violates the country’s immigration laws and regulations. “Investigation and records in the Ministry also revealed that Mr. Roger Brown was in possession of CERPAC that was not based on validly issued Expatriate Quota approved by the Ministry of Interior resulting to the violation of relevant immigration laws and regulations. “As a result of these, the honorable minister has determined that Mr. Brown’s continued stay in Nigeria is contrary to national interest.” Aregbesola also noted that Brown declined to attend the two invitations from the ministry’s panel during the investigation, claiming “to be unavailable even though we learnt he was in Abuja for other purposes at the time.” Brown was appointed as the CEO of Seplat in 2020 after he joined the energy firm in 2013 as the Chief Financial Officer (CFO).
