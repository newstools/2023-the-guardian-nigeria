The Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited has revealed why it replaced Eroton Exploration and Production Limited as the new operator of Oil Mining Lease (OML) 18.
  
According to the NNPC, this was done in order to protect the JV investment in OML 18, the non-operating partners, NNPC Limited (55 per cent interest) and OML 18 Energy Limited (“OML 18 Energy” – 16.20 per cent interest), jointly owned    71.20 per cent equity, removed Eroton as operator of the JV.
 
“This is in line with the provisions of the Joint Operating Agreement (JOA)”, Chief Corporate Communications Officer, NNPC Ltd, Garbadeen Muhammad, said in a statement.  Muhammad said some of these audits were regulatory steps that may lead to licence revocation under the relevant laws if non-operating partners did not take drastic steps.
  
“NNPC Limited in particular, as the majority shareholder with a unique stewardship responsibility to the federation, is committed to assuring that the energy and financial security of the country is uppermost in its business decisions.
 
“Removing an operator in these circumstances is therefore inevitable in order to protect the JV from governmental or third parties action from entities, including Eroton’s lenders and other service providers.
  
“It is important to highlight that OML 18 is an oil-producing block covering 1,035 square kilometres located south of Port Harcourt and contains 11 oil and gas fields with about 714 million Stock Tank Barrels (MMSTB) of oil and condensate and 4.7 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of natural gas reserves.
 
“Eight fields have been developed, but only four are currently producing: Cawthorne Channel, Awoba, Akaso and Alakiri,” he said.
