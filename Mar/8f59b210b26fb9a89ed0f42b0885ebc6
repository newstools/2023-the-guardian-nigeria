These bars are often made by combining the dry ingredients together and then mixing in the wet ingredients, such as melted butter or coconut oil, and honey or maple syrup to bind everything together. The mixture is then pressed into a baking pan and baked until golden brown. Once cooled, the mixture is cut into bars that can be stored and eaten as a convenient and healthy snack. Oatmeal Raisin Granola Bars are a popular choice for people who want a healthy and satisfying snack on-the-go. They are typically high in fiber, protein, and healthy fats, making them a great option for anyone looking for a nutritious snack. They are also versatile and can be customized to suit individual tastes by adding other ingredients such as chocolate chips, coconut flakes, or dried cranberries.

INGREDIENTS 3 cups old-fashioned oats
1 cup crispy brown rice cereal
1 cup raisins
1 cup sunflower seeds
¼ teaspoon salt
⅔ cup brown rice syrup
½ cup sunflower seed butter
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon PREPARATION 1) Preheat oven to 325°F. Line a 9-by-13-inch baking pan with parchment paper, leaving extra parchment hanging over two sides. Lightly coat the parchment with cooking spray.
2) Combine oats, cereal, raisins, sunflower seeds, and salt in a large bowl. Combine rice syrup, sunflower seed butter, and cinnamon in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave for 30 seconds (or heat in a saucepan over medium heat for 1 minute). 3) Add to the dry ingredients and stir until evenly combined. Transfer to the prepared pan and firmly press into the pan with the back of a spatula. For chewier bars, bake until barely starting to color around the edge and still soft in the middle, 20 to 25 minutes. For crunchier bars, bake until golden brown around the edge and somewhat firm in the middle, 30 to 35 minutes. (Both will still be soft when warm and firm up as they cool.) 4) Let cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then, using the parchment to help you, lift out of the pan onto a cutting board (it will still be soft). Cut into 24 bars, then let cool completely without separating the bars, for about 30 minutes more. Once cool, separate into bars.
