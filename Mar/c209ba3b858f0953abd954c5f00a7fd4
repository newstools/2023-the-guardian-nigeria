Abi Warriors Manager, Erasmus Onuh, has assured fans of the club of a successful ending to the 2022/23 Nigerian Professional Football League (NPFL). Abia Warriors are currently placed fourth on Group B log of the abridged season behind the trio of Lobi, Rivers United and Sunshine. Onuh said he is satisfied with the performance of his players before the league went on break, adding, however, that he is doing everything possible to get better results when action resumes after the general election. “The team I have is not yet where I want it to be, but I must say the boys are doing well. We are still building, but one thing that I want to assure the fans is that we will finish well. “The management of the team has equally been doing well and I pray that they give me the free hand to deliver,” Onuh said. The Abia Warriors’ coach also gave pass mark to the referees, saying they have been doing a good job. “You can see that this season you can win anywhere. That shows the referees and the league’s Interim Management Committee (IMC) are doing their jobs. I want to commend that and urge them to remain fair and firm when the second round gets underway.”
