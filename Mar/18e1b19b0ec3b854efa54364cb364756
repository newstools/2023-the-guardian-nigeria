Former House of Assembly member for Ogbadibo Constituency, Benue State, and Labour Party (LP) senatorial candidate in the last general election, Joseph Ojobo, has defected to the All Progressives Congress (APC). Sule Audu, who represented Agatu constituency in the last Assembly and Dave Iorhemba, who represented Guma in the 7th Assembly, had also defected to the APC.
Iorhemba’s defection on Monday was the latest. He was Speaker of Benue Assembly on the platform of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Audu was Minority Leader under PDP. The Guardian learnt that the governorship candidate of Action Alliance (AA), Bishop Sam Zuga, has also stepped down for the APC gubernatorial candidate, Fr Hyacinth Alia, and collapsed his party’s structure into APC.
