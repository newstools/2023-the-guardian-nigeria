Governor Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State has threatened to expose former governors of the state, who allegedly left a big hole in the state’s treasury. He warned that if they continue to talk, he would have no choice but to tell the world how they looted the money meant for development in the state and ferried some to United Arab Emirates (UAE) and other metropolitan capitals of Europe and America, where they allegedly acquired properties. According to him, one of the former governors was allegedly complicit in the missing N500 million meant for the reconstruction the popular WAFF Road, claiming that nothing was done on the road until he came as governor and turned the road into dual carriageway. El-Rufai added: “They are all looters. I know how they were before and look at their current status. One has built a big mansion in Kaduna at Jabi. “I challenge anybody, who has knowledge of our government collecting 10 per cent commission from contractors. But these people were collecting 10 per cent commission. I am a quantity surveyor. I know the quality of work they have done.”
