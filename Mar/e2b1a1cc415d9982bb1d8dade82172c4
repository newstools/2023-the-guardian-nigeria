Two people were initially confirmed dead and several were injured in the accident. The injured passengers were rushed to the trauma centre of the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH). Lagos State governor, Babajide Sanyo-Olu, who was at LASUTH disclosed that four of the victims were confirmed dead at the hospital. Two people were confirmed dead at the accident scene. Sanwo-Olu called for blood donors for victims that suffered injuries. Managing director of the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC), Fidet Okhiria, blamed the driver Lagos State Government staff bus for the accident. “According to the information I gathered at the scene of the incident, they said many cars stopped when they got to the level crossing while the Lagos State Staff Bus driver continued moving, which I don’t know why. “Maybe the driver thought he could pass before the train got nearer to him. He could not pass, and then the train crushed the bus; that is what we gathered. “The train was coming from Ijoko to Iddo.” Sanwo-Olu has declared a three-day mourning for those that lost their lives in the accident.
