They said that their decision followed a thorough analysis of the good works and rapid development in Lagos State, saying that they cannot sacrifice the various landmark achievements of Sanwo-Olu’s administration on the altar of bitter politicking. The governorship candidate of YPP in Lagos State, Adebayo Ajayi, who spoke on behalf of the political parties, said the governor’s consistency as a progressive democrat is worthy of commendation, adding that the candidates also observed at a close range his energetic campaign through the nooks, corners and crannies of the state. ALSO, the paramount ruler of Iba Kingdom, Oba Sulaimon Raji, has met with the leadership of the Igbo community in Ojo, Iba and Otto-Awori axis to canvass support for the re-election of Sanwo-Olu. Raji said that the meeting was imperative to ensure continuity in good governance.

Meanwhile, the leaders of the Igbo communities, in their response, said that Sanwo-Olu had proved to them that Lagos is a land of opportunities for all and they would mobilise support for his re-election.
