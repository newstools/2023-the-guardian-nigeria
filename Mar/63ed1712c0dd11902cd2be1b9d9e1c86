Nigerian winger Samuel Chukwueze has made the La Liga team of the week after coming up with an impressive performance for Villarreal during the weekend. Chukwueze double figures for both goals and assists this season after setting up his team-mates on two occasions as Villarreal beat Almeria 2-0 at the Estadio de los Juegos Mediterráneos on Saturday afternoon. The attacker actually looked to set two new personal records in the Spanish top-flight league as Villarreal aim to qualify for European competitions at the end of the season. Chukwueze has three goals and five assists in La Liga this season. His assist helped Gerard Moreno net the opener in 76 minutes while Villarreal extended their lead in 88 minutes through Jose Luis Morales’ superb volley assisted by Chukwueze. The Nigerian international who was substituted for Johan Mojica in the 89th minute has struck the net ten times and made ten assists in 34 fixtures across all competitions this season. The 23-year-old winger was selected alongside Javi Galan, Gonzalo Plata, Antoine Griezmann and Jorge Molina in the team of the week. Meanwhile, Chukwueze will make his 35th appearance of the season on Thursday when Villarreal visits Anderlecht at Lotto Park for the first leg of their Europa Conference League round-of-16 clash.
