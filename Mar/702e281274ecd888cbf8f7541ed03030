No fewer than 12 residents of Grow Homes Estate, along Kuchibiyi in the Kubwa area of the Federal Capital Territory, were kidnapped by gunmen, on Friday, at about11:30 p.m. A source said the victims were captured from two separate apartments in the estate. The gunmen, in their numbers, reportedly escaped through the bush track, which links the community to another village. The police and the estate security operatives, yesterday, launched a search in the bush with a view to rescuing the victims unhurt. When contacted, the spokesperson for the police in Abuja, SP Josephine Adeh, confirmed the incident, saying that nine persons, and not 12, were abducted. She added the police and the estate security were combing the bushes to ensure the victims were rescued. Adeh said: “Upon receipt of the distress call, we immediately deployed our men to the scene. The suspects, however, abruptly suspended their operations and took some victims with them into the bush. “Police operatives and the estate security are still combing the bushes in the area to ensure they are rescued unhurt.” She urged residents of the area not to panic and called on them to help the police with credible information that could lead to the arrest of the assailants. “We urge the residents to remain calm and assist with useful information that could lead to the swift arrest of these criminals,” Adeh added.
