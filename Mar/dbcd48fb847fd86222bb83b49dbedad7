Residents in Osun are still groaning over lack of access to cash at various banks. Most residents had expressed hope that after last Saturday’s Presidential and National Assembly elections, there would be availability of cash for them to withdraw at their banks. Some of them have argued that the naira redesign policy embarked upon by the Central Bank of Nigeria(CBN) was primarily to prevent politicians from getting cash to buy votes during the polls. Investigation by The Guardian revealed that most customers visited their banks on Monday and Tuesday with high expectations that the apex bank would have made cash available for commercial banks to give to their customers. But, their hopes were dashed as many of them could withdraw money, neither from the bank counter nor at Automated Teller Machines  (ATMs ) more than 48 hours after polls were concluded. Residents, who visited their banks in Osogbo, said few banks were only open for reports and other customer care-related issues, while others didn’t open at all. Some of the bank customers,  who spoke with The Guardian during separate interviews called on the Federal Government and Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to make money available for them.
