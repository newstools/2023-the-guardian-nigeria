The Special Adviser to the Labour Party (LP) presidential candidate, Peter Obi, on Technology and Strategic Alliances, Valentine Ozigbo, has charged all party candidates for Anambra State House of Assembly elections to mobilise their constituents and ensure victory in the March 11 governorship and House of Assembly elections. Recall that Labour Party secured over 90 per cent of votes in the presidential election in the state, won two of the three senatorial seats, and also won majority in the House of Representatives seats in the state. Ozigbo, who hosted all candidates in a Town Hall meeting at Grand East Hotel, Okpuno, Awka, at the weekend, commended the party’s achievements in the February 25 elections, and urged them to re-strategise to garner more seats in the state Assembly. He further explained that Saturday’s election provides a perfect opportunity to drive the message of a new Nigeria home in the state, insisting that it would boost morale of candidates for Saturday’s election to galvanise their constituents to ensure victory. Ozigbo said: “Now is the time to consolidate and ensure that we secure majority of Anambra House of Assembly seats. “The people of Anambra spoke with one voice on February 25, and that voice must echo in our state legislature. “You all represent the hope of millions of Nigerians, and we must prove to the people that they made the right choice by sticking with Labour Party. “Few months ago, no one gave our party a chance, but through the power of God, the will of the people and the leadership of Peter Obi, we have shaken the foundation of Nigeria’s corrupt political system and made Nigerians believe in the actualisation of a new Nigeria.”
