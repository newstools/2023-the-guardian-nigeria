The Army said it has rescued the Commissioner for Women Affairs in Cross River, Gertrude Njar, from kidnappers’ hideout. Army spokesperson Dorcas Aluko made the disclosure in a statement. Aluko said Njar was kidnapped on February 1 in the Mayne Avenue area, Calabar South. The Army spokesperson said the troops acted on actionable intelligence on the victim’s whereabouts and laid a tacit ambush for the kidnappers around Peter Effiong Creek, Messembe, Jebs. “The gallant troops tactically sprung an ambush to take the kidnappers by surprise while in search of the victim,” Aluko said. “In the ensuing melee, the criminals abandoned the victim and fled into the creeks.” Aluko said that the troops are on the trail of the fleeing criminals. The Army spokesperson said Njar is currently receiving medical treatment and will be discharged later. “The Commander 13 Brigade Nigerian Army commends troops for their gallantry and urges them to sustain the tempo against all criminal elements in the Brigade’s Area of Responsibility. “Members of the general public are also encouraged to continue providing timely and accurate information on criminal activities within their vicinities.”
