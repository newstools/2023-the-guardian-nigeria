Barely 72 hours to the State Assembly elections in Imo State, suspected gunmen have set ablaze the country-home of Engr. Ifeanyi Ozoemena, Peoples Democratic Party, PDP candidate for Okigwe council area. The Guardian gathered from an eyewitness who pleaded anonymity that the suspects, numbering over seven, arrived at Ozoemena’s compound in a Sienna Toyota Vagon around 2 pm on Tuesday.
After a failed attempt to get their target, the suspects allegedly threw explosive devices at both the houses and vehicles parked within the compound and drove out, shooting sporadically in the air. Reacting, Ozoemena expressed shock over the development, saying that it was by God’s grace that his household including his aged parents escaped the attack alive.
He described the incident as most unfortunate, barbaric and inhumane while calling on the security agencies for adequate security and to swing into action aimed at apprehending the perpetrators. He said, “I just thanked God for sparing the lives of my family members including that of my aged parents. If not for His grace, we would have been killed. I don’t know why some people will think of such evil against me. As I speak to you now, both my house and my father’s own were all burnt by the attackers. Also, all the vehicles parked in the compound were set ablaze.
“I have reported it to the police and I expect them to come to my aide as well as ensure that those behind this unfortunate, barbaric and inhumane act are arrested to face the consequence of their actions.” When contacted, the state Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Henry Okoye said he was yet to be briefed about the incident and promised to respond as soon as possible. But until the time of filing this report, no response was received from him. This incident happened two weeks after a similar attack was launched on his kinsmen including the State Commissioner for Youth and sports, Hon. Emeka Okoronkwo with properties worth hundreds of millions damaged.
