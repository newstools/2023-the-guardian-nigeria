Nigeria’S U-23 national football team, Olympic Eagles, will now host their Guinean counterparts at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium, Abuja, on March 22 in the final round of qualifiers for this year’s Africa U-23 Cup of Nations. The game was earlier scheduled for the Lekan Salami Stadium, Adamasingba, Ibadan, the same day. To reach this stage of the series, the 1996 champions defeated Tanzania’s U-23 team 3-1 on aggregate in October 2022, winning 2-0 at the Lekan Salami Stadium, Ibadan, after a 1-1 first leg stalemate in Dar es Salaam. The winner over two legs between Nigeria and Guinea will advance to the finals of the Africa U-23 Cup of Nations scheduled to be hosted by Morocco later in the year. It is also at the tournament in Morocco that Africa’s flagbearers at next year’s Men’s Olympic football tournament in Paris will emerge. The return leg against Guinea will be in Morocco on March 27.
