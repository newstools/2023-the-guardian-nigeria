Ahead of Saturday’s governorship election, elder statesman and leader of Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF), Edwin Clark, has given his blessing to Ken Pella, the candidate of Labour Party (LP) in Delta State. This happened just as Pela said the chance of LP winning Delta State on Saturday is very bright, adding that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) acted with impunity by not transmitting presidential election results as it is mandated to do. Clark, who gave his blessing to Pela, when the governorship candidate paid him a courtesy call in Abuja, said: “You will have my blessings and my sons are in the field, whoever follow the process and wins is my governor. “My hope, whoever becomes the governor of Delta State, my home state, should be a straightforward person, competent, respected and good character, not person that will embezzle our money at the expense of the state. Nothing can prevent me from giving my blessing, so, God will therefore guide you.” Answering questions from newsmen, Pela said the governorship election circle is different, as power resides with the people, adding that the chances of LP is bright because the people are solidly behind the party. He added: “The chances of LP is very bright in Delta and I am sure we are all aware that in the last election, the PDP, the ruling party in Delta was beaten for the first time by an opposition party. “This election circle is different, the power resides with the people. Our chances are very bright because we believe the people are solidly behind us. We will win this election fair and square.”
