The Enugu State Housing Development Corporation (ESHDC) has unveiled plans to remodel recreational, social and sporting facilities located at Liberty 1 Estate, Independence Layout, Enugu. The Corporation said this has become imperative after two years of efforts to restore and build befitting recreational, social and sporting facility for exclusive use of residents geared towards improving their living standard, which would be run, operated and managed by the Corporation. Chief Executive Officer of ESHDC, Chukwuemelie Agu, had, while condemning the unhealthy societal activities going on, especially at night in the estate, assured residents that, “the Corporation has mobilised resources to redesign, remodel and build a befitting recreational, social and sporting facility that offers state-of-the-arts services in line with highbrow density of the estate. “We have noticed that at night, miscreant and never-do-wells hibernate at the deteriorated facility to perpetrate and engage in all sorts of illicit activities, ranging from smoking Indian Hemp, indecent sexual advances, loitering and others, which are detrimental to life and property of residents. “We have received pockets of complaint from both residents and our monitoring team on the disturbing situation of facilities in the estate. We are assuring you that soon the glory of the place would return,” he said. Agu also reiterated commitment of the Corporation to ensure the property remained in good standard for maximum utilisation by residents.
