The Minister of Women Affairs, Dame Pauline Tallen, pointed out that the United Nations Women 2022 Women’s snapshot report revealed that women’s exclusion from the digital world has shaved $1 trillion from the gross domestic product of low and middle-income countries in the last decade, saying the loss could grow to $1.5 trillion by 2025 without action.
