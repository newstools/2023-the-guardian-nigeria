Cross River Child Protection Network (CPN), a Non- Governmental Organisation (NGO), has decried continuous silence of Governor Ben Ayade’s administration on the abduction of the state Commissioner for Women Affairs, Prof. Gertrude Njar, 35 days after. The Guardian reported that Njar was kidnapped in the Calabar-South area of the state on February 1. The state coordinator of CPN, Kebe Ikpi, in a statement, yesterday, said it was worrisome to mark the 2023 International Women’s Day (IWD) in Cross River without the commissioner. While expressing fear over Njar’s safety and continuous stay in captivity, he frowned on alleged government’s silence and inaction over the incident. Ikpi said women’s morale was dampened as they marked the 2023 International Women’s Day without the commissioner. The day has the theme: “Digital Innovation and Technology for Gender Equality.” The statement reads: “Today makes it 35 days since the kidnap of the Commissioner for Women Affairs in Cross River State. The sad incident happened on February 1, 2023. Thirty-five days later, IWD is being marked in the state with associate Professor Gertrude Njar still in captivity. It is a sad day for women in Cross River State, who will be celebrating IWD without their commissioner. “A lot of questions are begging for answers: Where is Prof. Njar, what is her crime for which she was taken away, is the governor aware his commissioner has been abducted, what is the government doing to secure her release, why is there so much silence since her abduction, what are security agencies doing to rescue her.”
