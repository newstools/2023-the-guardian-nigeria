Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Akwa Ibom State has called on political parties not to heat up the polity with fake information, promising to correct lapses observed In last elections. The commission said it is ignorance that would make anyone to say INEC preloaded BVAS machines, stressing that BVAS machine has nothing to do with the election results as all it does is accreditation of voters and taking pictures of results at polling units. The state Resident Electoral Commissioner, Dr. Cyril Omorogbe, who made this known in a chat with The Guardian, stressed that for better polls, electoral materials will arrive councils 48 hours to election. Omorogbe said INEC would not repeat any observed lapses on Saturday, adding that the Commission has not deceived Nigerians with BVAS. He said: “We won’t repeat our lapses during the governorship and state Assembly elections, we will do a lot better on Saturday in the sense that we have seen areas where we didn’t do well, we have studied what the general public complained about and now have solutions to them. For example, we left Central Bank on Friday for the presidential elections, but for the coming Saturday elections, we will be leaving Central Bank with electoral materials on Thursday, 48 hours to elections, to different councils.
