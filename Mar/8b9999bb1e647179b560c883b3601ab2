The Congress for Rights Of Yoruba Nationalities (CROYN) has warned former President Olusegun Obasanjo to desist from subverting the yearnings, aspirations, and development of Yoruba people, noting that his actions and utterances since the days of late Chief Obafemi Awolowo had been undermining the collective goal and legitimate desires of the region.  Therefore, as a self-respected person, he should allow Yoruba people to choose their own candidate and the sanctity of that choice as endorsed by the majority of voters.”
  
It charged the Owu chief to emulate self-respected former leaders such as Yakubu Gowon, Ibrahim Babangida, Abdulsalam Abubakar, and Good-luck Jonathan who after leaving office have continued to play the role of true statesmen and genuine patriots as ambassadors for peace, unity, and security, distancing themselves from partisanship.
