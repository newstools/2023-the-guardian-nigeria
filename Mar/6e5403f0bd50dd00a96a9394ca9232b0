Download logo On March 9th, Ambassador Randy Berry, U.S. Ambassador to Namibia, hosted a solar panel installation and sustainable design ceremony to highlight the strides the U.S government is taking to support Namibia’s sustainability goals to lower and use of renewable energy. City of Windhoek Mayor Joseph Uapingene, government officials, members from NamPower and other civil society interlocuters attended the event held at the new embassy compound.  “Namibia is blessed with some of the world’s best solar power potential, and we are proud that the new embassy compound will feature a 403 kWP solar array that will power 50% of the Chancery’s needs. This is equivalent to offsetting carbon emissions from 87 passenger cars per year, and it represents a significant step towards decreasing foreign energy dependence,” said U.S. Ambassador Berry. Over 900 solar panels worth $410 000 USD (approximately 7,5 million Namibia dollars) were installed to support the energy needs of the new embassy compound. In addition to making the new embassy compound energy efficient, the U.S. government in conjunction with contractor B.L. Harbert International have implemented other environmental sustainability and corporate social responsibility initiatives, such as planting over 4000 native plants which require zero irrigation. B.L. Harbert International also held a lunch donation project, providing over 350,000 meals to school age children. The U.S. government has invested approximately $17 million USD (approximately 310 million Namibia dollars) into the Namibian economy with the construction of this new compound. More than 2,000 Namibians are employed in the construction project, of which 130 were women. As highlighted by Ambassador Berry, “The United States is committed to working hand-in-hand with Namibia to build a brighter future for all of us”.
