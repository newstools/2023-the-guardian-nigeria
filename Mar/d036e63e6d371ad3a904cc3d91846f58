All Progressives Congress (APC), Cross River State has rejected Senator Ben Ayade’s defeat at the just concluded February 25, Northern  Senatorial election where Senator Jarigbe Agom Jarigbe was declared the winner. The state party chairman, Mr Alphonsus Ogar issued the threat yesterday at the party Secretariat in Calabar while briefing newsmen on what he described as a pyrrhic victory for the PDP. Oga who threatened a lawsuit accused the opposition party, PDP of conniving with some military personnel to rob them of their victory. Ogar alleged,” Nefarious behaviour of some generals who connived with our opposition to intimidate and harassed us. That declaration is a pyrrhic victory that will evaporate into the thin air. “They deployed tanks through the aide of some of their sons, particularly in Ugaga Community and got us intimidated, We reject that in totality.” While condemned in total, the State APC Chairman wondered why the governor was not informed of the deployment of military personnel to the election ground. He said, “Those who deployed soldiers should be tried and court marshalled. You cannot deploy soldiers without the knowledge of the state governor. “One finger cannot thumbprint all ballot papers. Maybe forensic experts would have to wade into the matter.” Oga lamented. He however enjoined the party supporters to be calm and not to be involved in any form of violence.
