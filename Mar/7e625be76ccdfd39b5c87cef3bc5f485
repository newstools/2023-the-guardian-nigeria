However, to achieve this, there is a need for appropriate policies, infrastructure, and investments to ensure that technology is accessible and affordable for all. Nigerian women stand in solidarity with the United Nations to call for peace in Nigeria and the world at large,” she said The minister who explained that “for the first time, the Nigerian government has adopted a gender-perspective budget approach in its Fiscal Plans, Policies, and projects”, said  “this means that more than ever before women and girls issues have come to the fore in our National Development Plans; including that of those living with disabilities.  This has led to significant efforts in the roll-out of joint programmes in National Budgets, ICT, Education, Agriculture, Health & Nutrition, Environment, Security Architecture, Sports, Humanitarian support, Justice System and other sectors to equip women and girls with the necessary skills and tools to effectively participate in National Development.” According to her, these efforts are hinged on the 35% Affirmative Action principle in the Revised National Gender Policy 2021 to 2026 While congratulating the UN Bureau on the excellent organization of the affairs of the 67th session of the CSW, Tallen expressed confidence that the outcome of the deliberations will equally be fruitful.
