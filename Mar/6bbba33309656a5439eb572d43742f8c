It has proven itself time and time again to captivate people for centuries and transcend generations. There’s no fragrance as classic as a vanilla scent. It has proven itself time and time again to captivate people for centuries and transcend generations. Vanilla is a creamy, warm, syrupy scent that is reminiscent of freshly baked bread, cookies in the oven, and cozy flavored cereal. It is THE gourmand scent (gourmand perfumes: also known as ‘edible’ perfumes are fragrances consisting of synthetic and also real edible notes such as honey, chocolate, vanilla or candy)
So basically, they are perfumes for people who want to smell good enough to eat. Vanilla-based perfumes have always been an industry favorite, but in recent years, the mania for collecting this gourmand fragrance has everyone in a bid to get the best smelling and long lasting ones.
There are variations to vanilla scents – we have bourbon vanilla, warm vanilla sugar etc, all of which are versatile in the sense that they can be mixed with several other scents to create a complex fragrance and still not lose its touch. Scents like musk, patchouli, sandalwood, cedar are often layered with vanilla. Tom Ford – Tobacco Vanille
Vanilla, but with a twist. Tobacco Vanille was inspired by English gentlemen’s clubs.
This fragrance is for girls that love masculine smoky scents, but still want to maintain an air of ‘girly-ness’ to them. The best of both worlds really.
This fragrance takes vanilla to the spicy side with notes of Tobacco Leaf, Cacao, Tonka Bean, Dried Fruits and Tobacco Blossom. Vanille Antique – Byredo
Warm and sweet. If you’re looking for a “grown woman” take on vanilla, opt for this fragrance. It has a luxe and rich quality to it because of added notes like amber, cashmere and plum. She’s sensual, dark and mysterious with a hint of smokiness. Coffee Break – Maison Margiela REPLICA
Think sweater weather, warm hugs and of course, an iced vanilla latte. Coffee Accord, Milk Mousse and Vanilla give it a refined, pastry shop element, while the added note of Lavender makes it crisp and fresh. It has a perfect balance between sweet and fresh and you’ll receive tons of compliments wearing it.
