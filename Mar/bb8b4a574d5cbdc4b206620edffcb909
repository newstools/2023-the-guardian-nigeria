Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, yesterday, unveiled an iconic Shopping Mall Complex and Estate in Ede, Osun State. This came as the monarch disclosed that he had trained over 750,000 youths over the years and that all of them have been doing well in their respective professions. Oba Ogunwusi, at the commissioning of the projects, said the investments would usher tremendous economic prosperity to the state. While addressing the audience, including traditional rulers, industrialists, among other professionals, he urged the state governor to seek Federal Government’s support to develop housing estate in the area because of its proximity to the state government’s secretariat. The monarch said: “Development that Osogbo, which is the state capital and Ede is witnessing, is making it difficult to know the boundaries of both communities. I want to enjoin Governor Ademola Adeleke to seek Federal Government’s support to develop housing estate here because of its proximity to the state government secretariat. It will be an added feather to your achievements as governor. “I want to appreciate the youths for developing this estate. This project will attract economic development to the state. I have trained over 750,000 youths in different professions. We have initiated another project like this in Akure. I have many youths who are developing my projects across the country.” Governor Adeleke, while officially commissioning the Ojaja More Shopping Mall and Estate, which is a stone throw to the Osun State Government Secretariat, Abeere, expressed happiness at the construction of the project, saying that it was a greater joy for him that the commissioning coincided with his 100 days in office. He said the project would transform economic outlook of the state and open up the host community.
