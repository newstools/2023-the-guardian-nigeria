There is confusion in the Rivers State Chapter of Labour Party (LP) following claims by one Prince Fataa-Princewill that he is now the authentic governorship candidate of the party. Fataa-Princewill, as quoted in some online publications claimed his name was submitted to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) sequel to court judgment of February 2, 2023, which recognised him and Joyce Shyngle as his running mate. In a swift reaction however, the recognised Governorship candidate of the party, Mrs. Beatrice Itubo, who has been campaigning for several months has dismissed the claim, describing it as a sponsored antics aimed at distracting supporters of the party in the state. She therefore, urged the public to disregard the falsehood and not allow it to distract them.	Speaking with The Guardian, yesterday, Itubo said, “I am still the governorship candidate of the Labour Party in Rivers State. The man is a clown, I don’t know who paid him to cause confusion, the public should just disregard him and his false claims. “The most important thing is that the electorate should vote for Labour Party on March 11 elections, the party knows their candidate, so there is no cause for alarm.” Itubo who has been the State Chairman of Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) said, “I am not worried, I am not deterred and we cannot be distracted no matter their antics.  As we speak, I am at the national office of Labour Party and I have the support of my national party leaders.” Reacting to the development, a member of LP in the state, precious Iwor, said, he was a delegate at the primary election that produced Itubo as the governorship candidate, confirming that Fataa-Princewill was no where near the venue of the primary election.
