We’ve bid farewell to dry, chapped and flaky lips in 2022, we’re now welcoming all the goodness of lippies in their full glory.
Below, we’ve shared the lip products we think your lips will love; Fresh Beauty – Sugar Lip Polish
Just like the rest of your skin, your lips can dry out and need some exfoliating to slough away the dead skin cells and give way to smoother-looking lips.
This lip scrub gets rid of dry flakes, leaving you with soft and supple lips. It is also infused with shea butter and jojoba oil to pack on hydration. Clarins – Lip Comfort Oil
Lip oils are hybrid products. They’re not quite as glossy as traditional lip glosses, but they’re more hydrating than a lip balm. They also double as lip treatments and cosmetic products in one as they consist of nourishing ingredients.
The Clarins Lip Comfort Oil is a nourishing tinted lip oil enriched with Organic Rose oil, Jojoba oil and Hazelnut oil for plenty of moisture. Nivea – Moisture Essential Lip Care
Prioritizing a minimalist ingredient list and moisture.
This lip balm helps lips feel instantly hydrated and protected from dryness, while also providing moisture with its infused Shea Butter, Jojoba Oil and Avocado Oil. Fenty Beauty – Gloss Bomb Universal Lip Luminizer
Arguably one of Fenty’s best-selling products as it’s always sold out everywhere.
Coming in different shades, drench your lips with this universal lip luminizer that conditions the lips with Shea Butter and makes the lips look luscious, fuller and smoother with its gorgeous shimmery finish.
It also has a delicious peach-vanilla scent which makes the gloss experience even better.
