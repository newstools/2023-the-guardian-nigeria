Women in Enugu State, yesterday, raised the alarm over purported moves to create violence during Saturday’s governorship and state Assembly elections and called on Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, religious leaders and traditional rulers to instill peace in the state during the elections. In a statement, in Enugu, Executive Director, Heroine Women Foundation, Onyinye Mamah, who is the President, Women Support Women (WSW), stated that a good number of youths are posing to be instruments of violence, stressing that the state cannot be burnt down for political positions, which are transient. She said: “The civic space is bleak and darkened. Speculations, angst and intelligence from within the state reveal that a number of youths are posing to be instruments of violence, and we can’t let this happen. Fathers; you can’t let this happen and you can’t smoothen it out with funds or its likes. “We can’t let our state be burnt down for ephemeral position. “The people have suffered enough in these times and seasons to hear that somebody or a bullet hit somebody for want of a major party or candidate; every breathe matters, not to talk of killing someone for coming out to cast his or her vote. We can’t go 24 years back; we would rather move 24 years better.”
