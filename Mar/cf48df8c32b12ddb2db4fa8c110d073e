Popular South African Rapper Costa Tsobanoglou aka Costa Titch has reportedly passed away on Saturday while dazzling festivalgoers at the Ultra Music Festival in Johannesburg. He was known for is popular hit “Big Flexa”. The singer died while performing on stage. Videos of the musician performing online show him falling down during the song but continued after being lifted up by his security. But he fell again and needed to be taken off the stage. The story was confirmed by South African media personality Phil Mphela late Saturday night through Twitter.
Costa Titch, RIP, Mphela tweeted  “RIP: Costa Titch. Nelspruit-born artist and dancer, real name Costa Tsobanoglou, has passed away. He was 27.”
With singles like “Big Flexa,” “Nkalakatha,” and “Activate,” Titch gained popularity for his contribution to the Amapiano genre. The emerging singer most recently inked a contract with Konvict Kulture, Akon’s record company.
After his colleague Kiernan Forbes, alias AKA, was shot and killed in February, Costa’s passing is yet another devastating loss for the South African music business.
