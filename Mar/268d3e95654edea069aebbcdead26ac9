Second term serving member of the House of Representatives for Ikwuano/Umuahia Constituency and All Progressives Congress (APC) senatorial candidate for Abia Central in Saturday’s presidential and National Assembly polls, Sam Onuigbo, has tasked his party leadership and Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to resolve the issue of his missing name in the poll’s result sheet. Addressing journalists, yesterday, at Umuahia, Abia State capital, Onuigbo said he was announced by INEC to have lost in the poll, which was won by his Labour Party rival, Darlington Nwokocha. He said the conduct of last Saturday’s election left much to be desired such that INEC failed in its statutory responsibility of ensuring free, fair and credible poll. He said: “It is disheartening that INEC failed to include my party’s name on the result sheet for the 2023 Abia Central senatorial election, and, consequently, the documentation of my scores in the election was shambolic.”
