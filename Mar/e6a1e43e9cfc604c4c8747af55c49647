The Nigerian equities market rebounded at the reopening of transactions, yesterday, as bargain hunting in MTN Nigeria and 15 stocks pushed market capitalisation by N41 billion. Specifically, at the close of transactions yesterday, the All Share Index (ASI) rose by 76.36 points, representing an increase of 0.14 per cent to close at 55,605.57 points while the overall market capitalisation gained N41 billion to close at N30.291 trillion. The upturn was impacted by gains recorded in medium and large capitalised stocks, amongst which are; MTNN, Julius Berger Nigeria, Okomu Oil, Nigerian Aviation Handling Company (NAHCO) and United Capital Plc. Reacting on market performance, analysts at United Capital Plc said: “We expect the overall bullish sentiments in the equities market to linger. This is hinged on the view that investors’ bullish sentiments will prevail amid post-election uncertainties and a depressed interest rate environment, particularly at the short end of the curve. “We foresee opportunities for buy-side investors to increase holdings in the near term on fundamentally sound stocks with improved valuation and dividend yield. Nonetheless, we still expect profit-booking activities on stocks that have crossed the overbought region.” However, market sentiment, as measured by market breadth, was negative as 20 stocks declined, relative to 16 gainers.
