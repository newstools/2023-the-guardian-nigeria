When trying to book your next picnic or place of fun, it is better to have access to what the road and place may look like. In our country of busy lanes and times, these five applications should help you book your group travels.
These applications have been accessed, tested, and the links for their download have also been made available. Your group of friends or family is bound to have a rollercoaster ride through your travels. Hopper
Hopper is an app you certainly want to use while you are budgeting a family or group trip. As a mobile phone app, it is equipped with a price range, and navigates through the various places you will like to go. What makes this trip app precious is its position of detail. It does not just tell you guys where to buy your ticket, but gives you a date when the price will probably rise. You can speak through Hopper, too, with a commission figure of a few naira or currency depending on which part of the world you are in. MiTravel (Web)
MiTravel helps you visualize everything you have to do about a project. Just like the name, MiTravel helps to plan group traveling at a very convenient level. The app is so interesting that it helps you to collaborate with other prospective travellers in their groups and also to decide and collaborate what each group will offer at their intended places of meeting. And trust us best of all? It’s completely free with no hidden costs.
When planning a group trip, you’ll have to first add the location (country, region, or city) and trip dates. Then, invite any co-travellers to your planning board. Each trip has a few columns set up: Transit, Stays, Notes, Attractions, and Food cards. Each card has a simple text box, but you can also add attachments for things like your flight tickets or hotel bookings.
The Explore tab lets you search for and add places you intend to visit. You can save any attraction to your board, adding the group it belongs to. Cards can be moved around between groups easily.
When you’re traveling as a group, there are several decisions you need to make together. MiTravel offers a simple poll maker to get everyone’s opinion on an issue, which is visible to all participants.

Airbnb
Airbnb helps you find a place to crash, whether it’s a simple room in someone’s home or a luxurious beachfront property. The site also offers other kinds of bookings for travelers, such as tours, classes, and workshops. Whether you use Airbnb to find a place to sleep or for inspiration about what to do on your next trip, you’re guaranteed to see big, beautiful photographs of it all. Plan Harmony
The plan harmony is a reminder that gives you a recommended place for you and your group of friends. It has a calendar where anyone can add an event or an idea to this calendar. However, plan harmony also gives the assurance of viewing where you want to go, images, and what is available to eat, for a friends reunion, or a get together between colleagues.
There are various categories on the app or website, and each category has different prompts for the details you add to the event, such as flight number, car type or confirmation code, locations and links, and so on.
Cost tracking is a major part of group travel, and Plan Harmony seeks to make it easier by letting you add costs for each event and specifying whether it’s the group cost that’s to be evenly split or the per-person cost. Culture Trip
Culture Trip was once an app and site for reading about travel destinations, but it has expanded to now offer package tours. Search for the country or region you want to explore, and Culture Trip dishes up multi day trips to your destination of choice, like an eight-day trekking adventure through Patagonia or a safari through the busy streets of lagos. You book these packaged tours directly through the app or website.
Culture Trip also has plenty of advantages and is cost effective if you are planning to go in groups. You can also download the app on your phone’s play store or access it on the website.
