• CP advises voters against succumbing to threats 
The Lagos State Police Command, yesterday,  pledged to prosecute promoters of violence on social media. The Command’s spokesperson, Benjamin Hundeiyn, in a statement, said the Command is aware of malicious, inciting, provocative and seditious contents being circulated all over social media with the intent to cause panic, disharmony and unrest within Lagos. According to him, the Command has begun investigation into the matter and will apprehend and prosecute those found culpable. Hundeyin said: “Residents should disregard all forms of messages, especially on social media depicting fictitious, fallacious and preposterous claims aimed at jeopardizing the peace currently being enjoyed in the state. “As the second phase of elections approach, Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Idowu Owohunwa, once again assures the electorate that the Command has fully deployed its human and operational resources in conjunction with sister security agencies to ensure free, fair and credible elections. “Voters are therefore encouraged to go out to exercise their franchise and not succumb to the panic tactics of a few unpatriotic elements masquerading as concerned and well-intentioned Nigerians on social media. “It is equally imperative to warn against mischief around the polling units and collation centres and beyond, as anyone found guilty will be promptly arrested and dealt with in accordance with the law. “Meanwhile, Lagosians are enjoined to call the Police should they notice any untoward happening around them on any of the following emergency numbers: 08127155132, 08065154338, 08063299264, and 08039344870.”
