Patriots Roundtable has told Nigerians that are aggrieved with the outcome of the presidential election to embrace peace for the unity of the country. Director-General of the political group, Uthman Shodipe-Dosunmu, asserted in Lagos, yesterday, that aggrieved presidential candidates could approach the courts for redress. Shodipe-Dosunmu, who said the international community acknowledged the outcome and even congratulated the president-elect, Bola Tinubu, urged citizens to begin the work of setting the country on the path of greatness. He urged Tinubu, whom he described as the most maligned, challenged and embattled politician in Nigeria’s history, to remain true to his inner self. “Tinubu has now reached an incredible height of the presidency of this great nation. Nothing can diminish this personal achievement. He has reached this height not because of the prodding and the assistance of man. He has defeated the furies of fate not because of personal perfection, but  because of some inner nudging that no man can begrudge.”
