Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, has saluted Edo people for their peaceful and orderly conduct during Saturday’s Presidential and National Assembly elections, noting that the outcome of the poll was unacceptable. In a statement, the Commissioner for Communication and Orientation, Hon. Chris Nehikhare, said the governor urged the people to remain calm and not take any action, which will undermine security and lead to destruction of property. Nehikhare said: “The Governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki, thanks the good people of Edo State, for the peaceful and orderly conduct during the general elections held on February 25. “The result of the election is unacceptable to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and we will duly seek redress through legal means, as outlined in the Nigerian Constitution to ensure that wrongs perpetrated in the electoral process are righted. “Just like the PDP, most of our people are unhappy with the outcome of the election and we have every right to be, but we plead for calm and restraint and urge that you do not take any action that will worsen the current situation.” He urged the people not take any action that would undermine security and lead to destruction of property. “As responsible citizens, let us be calm and work collectively towards the development of our state. We thank you for your sustained support, as always.”
