The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate for Oyo South Senatorial District, Joseph Tegbe, has urged his supporters to put the outcome of the last presidential and National Assembly elections behind them to ensure the re-election of Governor Seyi Makinde in the coming governorship election scheduled to hold next Saturday.  Tegbe called on his supporters to ensure that they cast their votes for the governor, assuring that they have a lot to benefit if Makinde is returned for a second term in office.
 
Members of the Tegbe support group from various zones of the state took turns to eulogize the Ibadan Mogaji, restating their commitment to his cause. They affirmed their readiness to double their efforts during the forthcoming governorship and House of Assembly elections scheduled for March 11, in accordance with Tegbe’s directive.
 
The PDP senatorial candidate urged his supporters not to be downcast at the result of the last election as declared by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).
 
He assured them that no stone would be left unturned to ensure that his stolen mandate is reclaimed.
 
“I, Joseph Olasunkanmi Tegbe, am assuring you that by the grace of God and with your support, I will reclaim my mandate. We have discovered some discrepancies and electoral fraud in some polling units across the nine local councils in Oyo South Senatorial District,” he said. He encouraged his supporters to remain enthusiastic about delivering Makinde’s mandate for the people of the state.
 
Tegbe also urged the people of the state not to be intimated, cowed, or blackmailed into voting for candidates who are only desperate to win elections, but without anything to offer them.
 
He reeled out the numerous achievements of the governor during his second term, assuring that he would do even more if given the second term mandate on March 11.
