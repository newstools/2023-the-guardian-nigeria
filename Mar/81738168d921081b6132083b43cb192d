The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) has announced that international runways 18R and 36L at Murtala Muhammed Airport in Lagos would be shut for repairs. FAAN disclosed in a statement on Monday that the runway will be closed for 8 weeks for maintenance. The agency stated that Taxiway B-18L will be used instead for all flight operations until the maintenance is done. Earlier this year, the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency shut down the same international runway for a few hours for maintenance.
