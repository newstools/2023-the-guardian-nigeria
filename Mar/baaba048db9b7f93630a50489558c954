The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has suspended Dr Nura Ali as the resident electoral commissioner (REC) for Sokoto State. INEC secretary Rose Orlaran-Anthony announced Ali’s suspension in a letter and disclosed that Hajiya Aliyu Kangiwa will take over as the new REC. INEC also directed Ali to stay away from the commission’s office in Sokoto until further notice. “This is to inform you of the commission’s decision for you (Dr Nura Ali), Resident Electoral Commissioner, Sokoto State, to stay away from the commission’s office in Sokoto state immediately until further notice,” Orlaran-Anthony said. “The administrative secretary is directed to take full charge of INEC, Sokoto State office with immediate effects.” While INEC did not disclose the reason for Ali’s suspension, sources said it might not be unconnected to the recent allegations of irregularities in the just-concluded presidential election in the state.
