The Savannah Conference of the Bullet Energy Drink Basketball Championship will tip off today at the Moshood Abiola Stadium, Abuja. The competition will end on March 18. According to the organisers, 15 teams from the Federal Capital Territory and environs will battle for national finals tickets at the six-day competition. The teams are Civil Defence Basketball Club, Correctional Services, Hot Coal, KOK, TNT and Apo Settlers. Also in the championship are former national Divisions One and Two champions, Nile University, Titans Basketball, Abuja Rockers and Gilali Club. The Sam Oguche Foundation, which is running the competition sponsored by Bullet Energy drink, has promised an entertaining championship. Speaking ahead of the event, Oguche said the FCT gathering is a prelude to other events to be sponsored by Bullet Energy drink later this year. “We had to put this event together because we want to reach as many parts of the country as possible and of course touch as many players as possible. “We have had more competitions around Lagos in recent times, and so, we are now pushing more to different sections of the country. Remember that Asaba is just by the corner to host another round of the event. We are moving to Delta State for the next stage from here,” Oguche said. Meanwhile, the women version of the championship billed to dunk off next week at Asaba, has been rescheduled to a new date following the sudden change in calendar of the governorship election as announced by the Independent Electoral Commission (INEC). First Bank, MFM, Delta Queens, Tap Queens and Air Warriors are some of the teams heading to Asaba for the all-women tournament.
