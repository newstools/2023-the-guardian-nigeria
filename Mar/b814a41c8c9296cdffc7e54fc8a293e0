Police in Bauchi neutralised two suspected kidnappers at Rafin Gora in Ningi Local Government Area of Bauchi State on Friday and rescued their victim. Police spokesman, SP Ahmed Wakil, stated on Sunday in Bauchi that the gun-wielding assailants invaded the home of a resident at Rafin Gora and attempted to kidnap his 28-year-old son. “The victim resisted the kidnap attempt and was shot multiple times in his lower abdomen while trying to escape. “Police operatives in conjunction with a local vigilance group mobilised to the scene to confront the kidnappers who welcomed them with sporadic gunshots,’’ he stated. He added that the operatives effectively returned fire making the assailants to scamper in disarray with possible gunshot wounds. “Two of them met their waterloo, while one AK47 was recovered from them. “The 28-year-old victim was rescued and immediately taken to the Federal Medical Centre at Birnin Kudu for treatment,’’ Wakil stated. He added that a manhunt had begun for the fleeing suspects so they could face the law.
