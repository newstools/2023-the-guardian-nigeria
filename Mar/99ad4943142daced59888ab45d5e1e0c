The Bola Tinubu presidential campiagn spokesman in the south east, Dr. Josef Onoh, has repudiated recently elected senators and representatives from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the Labour Party (LP) who collected their Certificates of Return while their political parties are contesting the election that produced them and the president-elect, Bola Tinubu. According to the spokesman, it was hypocritical and also an act of double standards and deceit of the public, knowing that the election that produced both the National Assembly members-elect and that of the president-elect was conducted with the same BVAS on the same day, which their political parties are claiming were not used to upload the results that were obtained on the February 25 election day. He wondered why the senators-elect chose to probate and reprobate at the same time and at different venues of Certificate of Return collection and at the courts, respectively. Onoh said: “All the PDP and Labour Party senators-elect went and collected their certificates of return from INEC without complaints. This is the same election, same day, same polling units, by the same INEC, same processes, and same BVAS. And this was the same election they claim was rigged. “They should have rejected their certificates in protest. PDP and LP have validated the election. I’ve always said that the PDP as a party is a bus driven by a Dubai bound driver, using a wrong Google map directed by a Givenchy clad conductor and Oshodi/mile2 bound passengers. On the other hand, the Labour Party is the Google map server that directed the PDP to perdition. INEC has been vindicated and Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, our incoming president, if you’re still in doubt go and Verify!”
