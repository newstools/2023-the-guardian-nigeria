Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, has denied rumours that he is lobbying to become chief of staff to the President-Elect, Bola Tinubu. Gbajabiamila was absent when elected members of the National Assembly were at the International Conference Centre (ICC) in Abuja to receive their certificates of return. There were reports that Gbajabiamila’s absence was because he is eyeing the chief of staff position when Tinubu is sworn in by May 29, 2023. However, speaking with journalists in Abuja on Monday, Gbajabiamila denied the reports. “I don’t know anything about that chief of staff thing,” Gbajabiamila said. “All I heard was that I didn’t come here last week to pick up my certificate and for that reason, somebody conjectured that must be about something about Chief of Staff. “I was in Lagos and I could not leave Lagos because I was campaigning for my party. That’s number one. “Again, it’ll interest you to know that I was not here four years ago to pick up my certificate because I couldn’t make it. I don’t think it is anything significant. I’ll pick up my certificate today or tomorrow.”
