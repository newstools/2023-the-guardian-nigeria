Warns Group To Steer Clear Of Southwest Politics
Popular pan Yoruba group, Oodua Youth Parliament (OYP), has disowned the factional Afenifere group, led by Supo Shonibare, following the endorsement of Labour Party (LP) governorship candidate, Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour, in Lagos. The group said the factional Afenifere group does not represent nor speak for the Yoruba race. Frowning at the group’s support for Rhodes-Vivour, OYP warned the group to stay away from Southwest politics. In a statement by the Speaker of OYP, Aare Abdulmajeed Oladimeji Oyeniyi, he declared his group’s support for the Lagos State’s All Progressives Congress (APC) gubernatorial candidate, Babajide Sanwolu, pledging they will secure one million votes for the governor in Saturday’s governorship election. He said just like the LP presidential candidate, Peter Obi, was defeated in the recently concluded presidential poll; Vivour-Rhodes will also lose to the incumbent Governor Sanwo-Olu in the governorship election. According to Oyeniyi, “It’s unfortunate that this factional Afenifere group that is supposed to rally round and ensure Yoruba’s victory in Lagos are now rooting for a LP candidate in Lagos.” “We therefore advise them to stay away from Southwest politics if they won’t protect Yoruba race interest. This is completely absurd. “In the Igbo land, it is considered an abomination to see a Yoruba or Hausa dominate their politicking. Neither have we ever heard in history that the Ohanaezes declare for a Yoruba to govern Anambra nor a Hausa to rule Imo State. “Oodua youths is therefore warning the factional Afenifere to stay away from Southwest politics and don’t complicate matters for us. The real Afenifere widely recognised in the Yoruba land is led by Pa Fashoranti.”
