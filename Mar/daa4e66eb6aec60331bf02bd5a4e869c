Lagos State governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has said he will suspend campaign activities in the next three days to mourn the victims of the train accident. Six people have been declared dead and several injured after a train collided with a Lagos State Government staff bus in Ikeja area on Thursday morning. The train trapped the bus on its rail and dragged it from Shogunle to PWD area of Ikeja. Sanwo-Olu visited those injured in the accident at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH). The governor, who is seeking a second term in office, announced that he will suspend all campaigns in the next three days to mourn those who died in the accident. He also described the accident as avoidable which a little patience would have prevented from happening. “I was at LASUTH to understand the condition of the victims of the bus/train accident. “The team at LASUTH expertly setup an outdoor triage centre which has contributed in saving lives, speeding up injury level profiling and supporting immediate critical action. “This was a totally avoidable incident that simply required patience and the need to follow proper transportation protocol. “There were 85 pax on board the bus with 6 deaths, 42 moderate injuries, 29 serious and 8 mild injuries according to the LASUTH classification scale. “Lagos is in a state of mourning and for the next 3 days, I am suspending all campaign activities. All flags will be flown at half mast and tomorrow all civil servants will work till 12 noon before returning home to be with their loved ones during this trying time. “It is still a critical period for some of the patients as we continue to call for blood donations across different state government medical facilities. “This is a call for our humanity to rise above all. I also thank LASEMA, the security agencies, staff and students of LASUTH.”
