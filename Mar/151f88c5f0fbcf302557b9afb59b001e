Justice Bala Usman of the Federal High Court in Jalingo, Taraba State, has upheld Senator Emmanuel Bwacha as the authentic elected candidate of the All Progressive Congress (APC) for the governorship election. In the ruling, the court upheld Bwacha’s candidature while ruling on the case brought forward by the APC asking the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) not to remove its flag bearer from its portal or ballot paper for the elections. Justice Usman said it is important to uphold the judgment of the Supreme Court which has a consequential order instructing the ruling party to conduct a fresh primary where Bwacha emerged as APC’s candidate. He explained that if anyone was not satisfied with the conduct of the primary it should be an aggrieved party to file a pre-election matter and where no one did to challenge the outcome of the primary, Bwacha remained the legitimate candidate. Taking questions from pressmen, APC counsel shortly after the court judgment stressed that INEC does not have the powers to exercise the powers of a court by removing Bwacha’s name from its website.
