The ruling All progressives Congress (APC) has called on the independent national electoral commission (INEC) to preserve and protect the integrity of the extracted data from the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS). APC in a statement by its national publicity secretary, Barr Felix Morka enjoined INEC to use the opportunity presented by the election postponement to address any gaps identified in the presidential election in order to avoid a reoccurrence in the March 18, election. Expressing support over the shift of the governorship and states Assemblies elections, the party insisted that its presidential candidate Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu won the poll in a free and fair manner. It noted: “Even as Presidential Candidates and their political parties explore and exercise their constitutional liberty to challenge or defend the outcome of the Presidential and National Assembly elections, we must remind ourselves of the overriding duty that we bear to eschew conduct and action capable of undermining the peace of our country or imperil the capacity of INEC to conduct the upcoming Gubernatorial and State Assembly elections. “Our Candidate, now President-Elect, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu emerged as the overwhelming choice of Nigerians in the presidential election which was free, fair and in substantial compliance with the Electoral Act and INEC Guidelines for the 2023 General Elections. “We are thankful for our renewed presidential mandate, and urge our supporters and indeed all Nigerians to double down on their support for our great Party, and its candidates in the upcoming Gubernatorial and State Assembly election.”
