Emovon also advised the youths to work hard, shun crime and take their destiny into their hands as future leaders. He said that as part of the church’s Corporate Social Responsibility, it had paid registration fees for 247 youths to write the 2023 Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) Examination. Emovon, who spoke during the dedication of the ultra-modern Children’s Church, said: “ You are the future leaders, work hard, be serious with your studies, aim at getting a First Class during your graduation. If you get a First Class, work will look for you, but if get a lower grade, you’ll look for work…” He also admonished them to be good ambassadors of the country, saying that beneficiaries were not only Christians as there were some Muslims. While dedicating the building, Special Assistant to the General Overseer on Missions / Provincial Pastor, LP 40, Pastor Brown Oyitso, spoke on the theme: “Season of New Beginning.”

Quoting from Ecclesiastes 3:1-4, he said: “To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven: a time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck…” He prophesied that Nigeria would be great again. “There are seasons in Nigeria: dry and rainy season. In other climes, there are winter, spring, summer and autumn. Day must break. Get expectations from yourself and from God. There will be divine visitation. A new beginning, means there will be a new song to sing. There will be a new dawn in Nigeria…” He encouraged all citizens to have faith in God.
