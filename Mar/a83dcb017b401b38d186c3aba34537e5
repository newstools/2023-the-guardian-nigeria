Road Transport Employers Association of Nigeria (RTEAN) has commended the Armed Forces and other security agencies for being neutral in the last presidential and national assembly elections. The association also expressed optimism that the emergence of Tinubu as President-elect would usher in progress and development in the country as he had done in Lagos State from 1999 to 2007. National president of the RTEAN, Ambassador Musa Muhammed Maitakobi, in a statement signed by Deputy National President Administration, Muhammed Bishara, said the former Lagos governor has demonstrated a consistent fidelity to progressive and welfarist ideals, and an ability to build bridges across several divides. Maitakobi added that reports from different parts of the country indicated that the Armed forces of Nigeria had kept to its promise and indeed not only was apolitical but collaborated with other security agencies. While describing the voting process as good and well-arranged, he observed that the deployment of technology has made the elections different from previous ones. He said: “The RTEAN National President urges candidates in the various parties in the just concluded Presidential and National Assembly elections to accept the outcome of the election in good faith, and pointed out that there is the need for both the contestants and their supporters to keep their minds open and be ready to take whatever be the outcome of the presidential and National Assembly polls. “He also enjoined members of the association and Nigerian youths to remain law abiding and eschew conduct capable of leading to disturbance of public peace. “He appealed to religious and traditional leaders and principals of schools and NGOs to join RTEAN in sensitizing the youths against embarking on any criminal act that might destroy their future.”
