The Police in Enugu State, yesterday, confirmed disruption of commercial activities in the state by hoodlums enforcing Monday sit-at-home order. The hoodlums, under the diriective of Simon Ekpa-led faction of Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB), were on rampage in parts of the state setting ablaze two Sienna buses and five commercial tricycles, popularly called Keke NAPEP. Eyewitnesses said the incident occurred in early hours of yesterday at Liberty Bus Stop, Abakpa, Enugu East Council.
 The armed men, according to eyewitnesses, stormed the ever-busy bus stop at about 05:30 a.m. shooting sporadically to scare residents, who were coming out of their houses for the day’s activities. The gunmen were said to have moved to the popular T-Junction where they attempted to force an elderly man out of his car before allegedly burning him inside the car. “They stopped the man and commanded him to step out of the car; he resisted, and that made them open the fuel tank, shot into it, making the car go up in flames with the man inside,” said an eyewitness. Reacting, the Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Daniel Ndukwe, said normalcy has been restored in the area. He added that there was no casualty, stressing that operatives are on trail of the hoodlums. Ndukwe disclosed that two vehicles used by the hoodlums for the operation had been recovered, and called on members of the public to help the Command with useful information that could lead to arrest of the gunmen.
