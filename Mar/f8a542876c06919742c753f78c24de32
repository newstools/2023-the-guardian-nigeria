It is a culture, a product of a chain of cultures that is constantly projected, instilled and sold. A major ingredient of preparing to relocate to or travel to Lagos is the prep talk.
“Don’t trust strangers!” “Don’t mind the person next to you!” “Don’t smile too much!” “Don’t name the price with your church by mind in Lagos!” “Always be ready to run!” While many of these advices are given with good intentions and appear to be necessary in a busy State like Lagos, the time they come with connote a sense of importance that can be scary. It makes you wonder why a city is so difficult and how people living there survive. Over the years, this “Lagosness” in Lagosians has built momentum and now, like every culture that’s seen endless years of deaths and births, it seems impossible to fight. Now, instead of addressing the roots of this agelong self-centredness that’s stealing the joy of a city that holds a nation’s economy together, when we talk, we say, “this is Lagos” or “Lagos is for tough people”. There is no doubt that it takes tenacity to survive in a city this large, fast paced and busy, but since when did “survive” equal “live”. The strength of this city of BRTs is her economy (Africa’s “boom town” in National Geographic’s words). Lagos houses countless brilliant minds and ideas and has in its grip, a major share of the Nigerian Creative Industry. Lagos being a metropolitan city lacks the communal spirit that defines smaller towns. In this city, it is one man to himself.
On the one-man-to-himself nature of Lagosians, Mobolaji Adebayo, a Lagos-based Data Analyst said:
“It’s a function of people who live in cities. In cities, there is less of a communal feeling. And the only way to remain secure is to always have a guiding pose.” “I think it’s a direct response to living in the city. It’s a place where people come to transact. People are more concerned about making ends meet than making friends. I don’t think I will want to start a conversation with a random stranger I might never run into again because the truth is, I might never run into them till the next life.” he said. This self centered culture has grown roots in the lives of Lagosians. The strong desire to make money or survive at the expense of another’s convenience is also not uncommon in Lagos. And the belief that life and Lagos are not designed to be fair, seems to encourage Lagosians to be unkind. Technology has not been the most helpful.
