Osun State Governor, Ademola Adeleke, has charged the National Population Commission (NPC) to conduct a transparent census this year. Making the appeal when an NPC team, led by its National Commissioner, Senator Mudashiru Hussein, paid him a courtesy visit in Osogbo, the governor reminded his visitors that all eyes are on them to deliver. He said: “Despite the elections, we are taking the census project seriously. All levels of government, including town associations, are preparing” “The census is critical to national planning. Accurate census helps government to meet the needs of the people in term of infrastructure and services. “The history of the national census in Nigeria is controversial. We must get it right this time around.” Adeleke, in a statement by his spokesperson, Mallam Olawale Rasheed, urged the body to ensure error-free national head count, citing accuracy as key to acceptability of the outcome. He, specifically, charged NPC to embrace technology, submitting: “Accuracy can be enhanced when appropriate technologies are deployed in the headcount project.” “For us in Osun State, we pledge our commitment to mobilise our people for the exercise “I use this opportunity to call on Osun residents to participate fully. Just like general and state elections, getting counted during the census is a national civic responsibility,” the governor added. Earlier, the team leader told Adeleke that his delegation was in the state to sensitise residents to participation in the upcoming exercise The national commissioner, who drummed support for the project, assured Nigerians that his organisation was set to deliver.
