Governorship candidate of Labour Party (LP) in Lagos State, Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour (GRV), has confirmed talks with the leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state. The LP candidate told his supporters in Lekki area of Lagos that discussing with the PDP became necessary to forge a common front against the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the governorship contest next week. According to GRV, the APC government has mismanaged the state’s resources; hence, he is in the race to give back the people what belongs to them. His words: “We are talking to the owner of the structure of PDP. In the coming days, we will align with them to ensure that we take Lagos to the next level. People that are behind this movement are not moved by money; they are voting for hope, moved by the hope of a new Lagos and they are going to come out more than before. People have seen how one man in his interest rubbished the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) process; so, we are ready to fight.
 
“I have seen the pains of Lagos. We know for a fact that the current government will not reduce unemployment, but our government will make the youths productive members of the society. We are going to give them bright Lagos. “We have come too far to turn back, I Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour of the Rhodes-Vivour family from Lagos Island, a true blood of Lagos, promise to stand fast with you until the very end. When people are determined to make change happen, no force on earth can prevent them from making that change. So we must never give up.”
 
Speaking on fear of job losses, he said: “I also assure those in the employ of the state that none shall be victimised or made to lose their jobs when I assume office. We are coming to build a better Lagos for all.”
