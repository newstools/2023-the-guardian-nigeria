Operatives of Niger State Police Command have invaded the Minna Situation Room of All Progressives Congress (APC) gubernatorial candidate for Niger State, Umar Bago, and arrested whistleblowers suspected to be Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) members for false alarm and breach of peace. The Director, Digital and Strategic Communications of Bago Campaign Organisation, Abdulberqy Ebbo, told newsmen that after a post on Facebook, the police invaded the situation room. He noted that the Divisional Police Officer (DPO), who led the search, said he was reliably told that staff of the Independent Electoral Commission (INEC) were in the building with sensitive materials thumb-printing in favour of APC ahead of the March 11, 2023, gubernatorial and House of Assembly election. “I received a call that the situation room was being searched by the police. I rushed there and asked the DPO what was going on, and he said they were informed that INEC staff were in the room thumb-printing ahead of the governorship elections.” “When they finished searching, they discovered that there was no such thing going on in the building at that time. The Commissioner of Police also went to the premises,” he said. Ebbo disclosed that the boys, who raised the alarm, were arrested for giving false information to the police. His words: “As I was arriving the building, I noticed many PDP members standing by. Then I realised the report had come from them and they seemed ready to cause trouble. The CP stated that having a situation room wasn’t out of place.” Police Public relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Wasiu Abiodun, confirmed the arrest of two persons for false information and an attempt to breach the peace in the state. “The informant, who was identified as Ndagi, and one other were immediately arrested for giving false information and attempt to cause breach of peace at the scene,” he said. Abiodun, however, stated that the suspects were transferred to SCID for further investigation.
