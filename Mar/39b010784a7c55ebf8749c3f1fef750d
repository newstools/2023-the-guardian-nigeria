Governor Simon Lalong has lost his bid to represent the people of Plateau South in the forthcoming 10th Senate. The two-term All Progressives Congress (APC) state chief executive was beaten at the poll by his Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) rival, Air Vice Marshal Napoleon Bali (rtd). By the defeat, he has set a record of being the first two-term governor of the state to fail to make it to the Senate. His predecessors, Joshua Dariye and Jonah Jang, both achieved their ambitions.
