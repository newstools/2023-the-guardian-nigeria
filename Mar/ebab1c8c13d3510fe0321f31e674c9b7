Setting a record while also surpassing two-time record breaker Marvel’s “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” This makes it not only the biggest opening for a film in the Creed trilogy, but also the biggest domestic opening for a sports film since the remake of ‘The Karate Kid’ in 2010.
Creed III, directed by Michael B. Jordan, serves as his feature filmmaking debut as he also returns to his role of Adonis Creed, a main character first introduced in the 2015 hit Creed.
It managed to exceed its $75 million budget upon its release despite being the first film in the nearly 50-year history of the Rocky and Creed film franchises to not feature Sylvester Stallone. But Creed III has done a lot more than just breaking sports-movie records. A film blogger stated on Twitter that Creed III is also “the biggest opening ever for a Black director in their directorial debut”. Michael B. Jordan is not the only star of the show as his co-star, Jonathan Major, scored big with his leading role in the Marvel film ‘Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania’, giving him a box office dominance not every actor can speak of.
