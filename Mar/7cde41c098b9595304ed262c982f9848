Flying Eagles coach, Ladan Bosso, has hailed the country’s U-20 national team, following its impressive 4-0 bashing of Tunisia’s Les Aigles de Carthage in the third place match on Friday, at the CAF U-20 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Egypt. A brace by man of the match, Jude Sunday and two goals from Ibrahim Muhammad and Ahmed Abdullahi ensured that the most successful country in the U-20 competition in Africa recovered from last week semi-final misery against The Gambia to beat the Tunisians at the Cairo International Stadium. Bosso, who felt letdown with his players going down against the Young Scorpions, stated the difference in the two matches was the finishing. “Today we’re back in a better mood than after the semi-final match. So, we want to thank everyone that has been behind us. “The difference between today’s (Friday) match and that of the semi-finals against The Gambia is just the finishing. “Today (Friday), Tunisia kept the ball more, but they have loopholes in their defense line so we played the ball behind them to cause them problems,” Bosso said after the match. He added: “The man of the match Jude Sunday, was coming off the bench in the previous matches and today he started and made the difference. “So, if you get an opportunity you go and express yourself. Coaching at the U-20 level, you are a developmental coach, who develops players. “So, there’s no moral justification for me to carry 21 players and play six matches with some players not playing in the tournament.” It will be recalled that Sunday, like defender Abel Ogwuche won the man of the match awards on their first starts of the tournament following their substitute appearances.
