The governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in Taraba state, Lt Col Agbu Kefas (rtd), has boasted that he will win the March 18 rescheduled governorship poll in the state. He expressed optimism that the party will retain power given the dominance of the PDP in the just concluded Presidential and National Assembly polls. According to him, the PDP has done a lot and will continue to strive to take Taraba State to the promised land. Kefas stated these at the INEC Headquarters in Abuja when he accompanied two senators to collect their Certificates of Return. The senators-elect are the current deputy governor of Taraba State, His Excellency, Haruna Manu (Taraba Central) and Senator Shuaibu Lau (Taraba North). He said, “Our great party, the PDP will continue to shine. There’s no vacancy for the opposition in Taraba because we have done well and we promise to do more as we take the State to the promised land. Our determination to retain power come Saturday March 11 2023 is a battle of no retreat, no surrender. Our theme is moving forward and as you can see we are already surging ahead in the poll.” Earlier in their remarks the Manu said they came with the governorship candidate in their entourage to affirm their commitment to the party’s victory. The senator-elect added that with the dominance of the PDP at the national legislature, Kefas administration will enjoy tremendous support needed to move the state forward. On his part, Senator Lau said he would work assiduously to deliver Kefas in the northern zone because PDP is the only party that can guarantee development.
