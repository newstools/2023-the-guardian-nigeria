Transactions in the equities sector of the Nigeria Exchange Limited (NGX) reopened on a downturn, yesterday, as profit taking in NGX Group Plc and 20 stocks dragged market capitalisation by N4 billion. At the close of trading yesterday, the All-Share Index declined by 6.14 per cent, representing a decrease of 0.01 per cent, to close at 55,788.37 points. Similarly, the market capitalisation value lost N4 billion to close at N30.391 trillion. The market negative performance was driven by price depreciation in large and medium capitalised stocks, which are Nigerian Exchange Group, Zenith Bank, Guaranty Trust Holding Company (GTCO), Lafarge Africa and FBN Holding (FBNH). This week, United Capital Plc expects “the depressed interest rate environment to continue to favour the equities market in line with our expectations for Q1, 2023. “We believe that taking positions in stocks with solid valuations and dividend yields ahead of the dividend-paying season is a good strategy. However, we note that there may be profit-taking activities from the extended rallies.” The market breadth was negative as 21 stocks lost relative to 12 gainers.
