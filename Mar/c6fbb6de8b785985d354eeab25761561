It’s been declared that there’s no party like the Vanity Fair Oscar Party.
The Vanity Fair Oscar Party is held every year after each Oscars award show and it is graced by the biggest names in the industry. While the Oscars is strictly reserved for actors, the after party is open to more influential people like Influencers, musicians, models and so on. The stars graced the carpet with bold, fashion-forward and ethereal looks. It’s safe to say that the award show usually doesn’t come close to the styles seen at the after party where the stars pull out their most daring outfits.
