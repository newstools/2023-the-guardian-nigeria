The Chairman of Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Enugu State, Rev. Emmanuel Edeh, has advised politicians in the state to appreciate the enduring peace, which Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi has laboured to entrench by desisting from hate speech, campaign of calumny, character assassination and acts of violence ahead of March 11 governorship and state Assembly elections. Edeh, in a statement, said Christians in the state are worried over the rate politicians and their agents are going about overheating the polity, and maligning the integrity of their opponents, as well as the sacredness of leaders of religious institutions in their desperate attempt to score cheap political goals. He said: “These acts are strange and inimical to enduring, as well as cherished peace and good governance initiatives of Ugwuanyi’s administration since its inception in 2015.” Edeh described Ugwuanyi as “a peacemaker and wonderful person whom God has used in uniting and promoting peace, as well as in advancing good governance in the state, especially in rural areas, in the overall interest of long-neglected rural dwellers to feel the direct impact of democracy dividends.” Wondering why some people, who are too desperate for power, would resort to acts capable of undermining the governor’s legacy at all costs, the cleric recalled that he had, in one of the functions of CAN in Enugu, described Ugwuanyi “as a bulwark, strong pillar of faith and highly cherished partner of the Christian Community, who will be greatly remembered for his peaceful disposition, rural development initiative, inclusive governance, humility, compassion for the downtrodden, deep commitment to God, great respect for leaders of religious institutions.” Edeh expressed concern over recent political killings in the state, and prayed for repose of the faithful departed. He pleaded with those who might still be planning to unleash mayhem in the state to desist from such untoward acts, which the state is not known for.
