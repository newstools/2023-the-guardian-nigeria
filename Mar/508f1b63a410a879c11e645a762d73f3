Nigerian Professional Football League (NPFL) side, Enugu Rangers, have recruited three new players ahead of the second round of the abridged 2022/23 season. According to Enugu Rangers’ Media Officer, Norbert Okolie, the players, Austin Osayande, Leonard Ugochukwu and Chinecherem Ugwueze, who have already started training with the Flying Antelopes, were recruited to make the team better ahead of the final push for qualification to the 2022/2023 NPFL play-off tournament. Rangers recruited Osayande, an attacking midfielder, from Dakkada F.C, while Ugochukwu, a veteran of campaigner in the league, joined the club from Akwa United. Chinecherem, a young defensive midfielder, according to Okolie, joined Rangers from Nigerian National League (NNL) side, Giant Brillars F.C of Enugu. Speaking while unveiling the players at the club’s headquarters, G.R.A, Enugu, Rangers’ Administrative Secretary, Ferdinand Ugwuarua, said: “We are delighted to have the three players join our ranks to help us achieve our set target for the season. “With the approval of the coaching crew, we went for the players and it is our hope and belief they are coming with the needed skills and determination to help us achieve what we set out initially to achieve at the start of the season. ” Enugu Rangers have not been fantastic this season, taking a paltry nine points from the available 24, scoring four goals and conceding six. The players will play their first game for the club when Rangers take on NPFL champions, Rivers United F.C., in a rescheduled match day 8 fixture at the Adokiye Amiesimaka Stadium, Port Harcourt on March 15, 2023.
