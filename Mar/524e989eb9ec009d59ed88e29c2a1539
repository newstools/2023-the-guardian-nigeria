House of Representatives Leader, Alhassan Doguwa, and others were, yesterday, remanded in Gorundutse Correctional Centre for alleged culpable homicide and other criminal offences. Chief Magistrate of Court 54, Nomansland, Ibrahim Yola, gave the order when Doguwa and one Bashir Dahiru were paraded on five counts by state government. Parading the lawmaker representing Doguwa/Tudun-Wada federal constituency, and one Dahiru, Prosecuting Counsel, Aisha Salisu, told the court that the defendants were being charged for criminal conspiracy, causing grievous hurt, mischief use of firearms and inciting disturbance. According to Salisu, the lawmaker was accused of mobilising his thugs to unleash terror on Tudun-Wada Collation Centre on Sunday, February 26, where three persons died and eight others injured with dangerous weapons. The prosecution argued that the alleged offences violated provisions of Section 79 (7) of Administration of Criminal Justice Act (ACJA) and Section 247 and 221 of Penal Code of Kano.  Counsel to Doguwa, Abdul Adamu, sought further date for trial and applied for his client’s bail. Doguwa is a responsible member of his community with no criminal record, and would not jump bail if granted, he told the court. But the prosecuting counsel objected to the bail application, urging the court to consider the gravity of Doguwa’s offence. She pleaded with the court to remand the defendant pending the determination of the case. Yola ordered that Doguwa and Dahiru be remanded and adjourned till March 7, 2023 for ruling on the bail application. The police command in Kano had earlier confirmed the arrest of Doguwa at Kano airport on Monday on his way to board a flight to Saudi Arabia.
