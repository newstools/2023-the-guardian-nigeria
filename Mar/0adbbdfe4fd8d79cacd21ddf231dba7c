• Claims fake agents collated results Anambra State Coordinator, Obi- Datti Campaign Council, Jeo-Martins Uzodike, has alleged that the just concluded presidential and National Assembly election results declared by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) were collated in people’s homes in various states. Uzodike spoke to journalists in Awka, Anambra State, over the outcome of the election, alleging that fake agents did the collations. While challenging the results announced by INEC, he described it as day light robbery of the Nigerian people. He said that the international community has cautioned INEC and Federal Government to do the right thing and save the country from being plunged into crises. He expressed fears that youths in the country were becoming restive, and that the electoral Commission should be blamed for whatever reaction Nigerian voters may express. He said: “The Archbishop of Canterbury, the United States of America (U.S.A) and the entire international community have been talking, and, soon, these people would be denied entrance into those countries as a result of what they did at that election. “If your property is stolen and you caught the person red handed, you don’t need to wear long faces, because you will certainly recover it.” Citing discrepancies in some declared results by the INEC, Uzodike lamented that the whole thing is manifest, because it would seem like business as usual, adding: “Look at Ekiti State where what was uploaded was later wiped out and Labour Party got over 85,000 votes, and they gave it to the All Progressives Congress (APC) that actually got 13,000 votes. “Look at Gombe and Bauchi states having the same results for all the three major presidential candidates. The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Situation Room, Lagos, shows that Labour Party won with more than 900,000 votes, but in our own Situation Room, we got 1.23 million votes.”
