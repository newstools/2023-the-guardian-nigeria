House of Representatives member-elect for Calabar Municipality/Odukpani Federal Constituency in Cross River State, Bassey Akiba, has attributed his aspiration to represent his people in the parliament to the quest by an average Nigerian for a genuine change. Akiba, who disclosed this during interaction with newsmen, yesterday, in Calabar, also reiterated his resolve to ensure socio-economic well-being of his constituents. The Guardian reports that Akiba, a former member of the state House of Assembly, while thanking God for his victory at the poll, said no stone would be left unturned to give his people the best of representation in Abuja. Reacting to a question on his emergence as the lawmaker-elect for his constituency, Akiba said: “There was no magic.” It is time for Nigerians to stand up for a change. Nigerians were eager for a change, and I need to take advantage of that, and align myself properly with them.” He assured his constituents of inclusive and effective representation at all times, adding that they would be robustly engaged in every legislative business. Akiba, who was also a former Chairman of Odukpani Council of Cross River State, said efforts would be made to establish an economic structure as contained in his manifesto across the 494 political wards in his constituency. “I have told my people clearly that the process of my lawmaking will come down because we need the peoples’ inputs in every law we make. We need to engage our people in every step of the game so that their inputs can be carried along. “I will try and establish 494 economic structures in the 494 political wards we have in our federal constituency,” he added.
