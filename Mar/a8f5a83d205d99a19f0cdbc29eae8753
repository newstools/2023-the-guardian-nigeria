The 42-year-old reality star shared a selfie to her Instagram with 347 million followers where she appeared makeup-free and showcased her real and raw skin with no filter straight from the dentist’s chair (disposable bibs and all).
In the picture, she is seen with her signature slicked back braided ponytail hairstyle and a black hoodie. Some comments seen under this Instagram post are; “Yes an unfiltered selfie!!!”, “Nice to see Kim’s skin without makeup or a filter”. Others commented “Imagine being able to clean Kim Kardashian’s teeth” and “This is what I think I look like in the dentist chair except I don’t”. References were made to a ‘Keeping Up With The Kardashians Episode’ episode where Kim commented on her ability to smell cavities after hugging Lamar Odom, a former professional basketball player and her sister Khloe Kardashian’s boyfriend at the time.
