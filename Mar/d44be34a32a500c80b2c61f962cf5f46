I know I am wrong, but I did it and can’t take it back at this point.

Four months ago, I started to have an affair with my neighbour. We are both married. We both have children, who are friends and we have always spent a lot of time together. It all started off innocently, and over time, we flirted and started becoming emotionally attached. We are both in our marriages though we have our underlying issues. My wife and I have, twice, thought about divorce and both times, found ways to make it work. Again, we were going through a bad phase and then this happened. I don’t want to continue in my marriage and I am in love with my neighbour. I have known her for seven years, and the emotional part of our relationship has been growing over that period. Now that we have the ability to express our feelings to each other, our love has blossomed so fast. I guess I am not sure how to proceed with this.

I don’t want to hurt our kids, but I don’t want to remain married to someone I don’t love anymore. I know that infidelity is not the answer, but that ship has sailed and is not coming back. I want to get out of my marriage without her knowing what happened, but fear that once I start a relationship with this woman, it would be known. I want to know if it is worth taking the chance, so I don’t completely destroy my families. I know I will get a lot of people telling me how horrible I am. Yes, you are right, I am. Please, help me figure out how to best handle this situation without it going so horribly wrong for the innocent parties—James Advice: Please, dear readers, mail your comments, reactions or true love stories, quiz or personal experience you wish to share to this email: simonclar @yahoo.com For marriage counselling, please call Simon on 07032944123
