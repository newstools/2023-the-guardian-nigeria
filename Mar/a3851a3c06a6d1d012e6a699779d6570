Nigerian champions, Kwara Falcons, who lost their first game of the 2023 Basketball Africa League (BAL) to Rwanda Energy Group at the Dakar Arena, at the weekend, will, today, try to put their title ambitions back on track, when they meet Mali’s Stade Malien in their second game of the competition. Playing in the BAL Southern Conference, Kwara Falcons lost 48 to 64 to the Rwanda champions. The Nigerian champions won two of the four quarters, but lost the third quarter 8-24, a deficit they could not claw back in the fourth, which they won 11-9. With Jawad Adekoya, who made a three-point shot and led the attack against the Rwandan team, Kwara Falcons could yet reclaim their mojo in today’s game, especially if Anthony Wilson Jr., who made seven points, on Sunday, gets his acts right. Speaking ahead of the game, Wilson Jr. said his team is primed for a good outing.
“One game doesn’t define us. We got to fix what we need to fix and come firing on our next game,” said Wilson Jr. “Anything can happen. We have already proven that we belong here,” he added. Like Kwara Falcons, Stade Malien also lost their opening game to defending champions, US Monastir of Tunisia and would want to bounce back to reckoning with a good outing today.
  
After today’s games, Kwara Falcons will meet US Monastir in their third game tomorrow at 4.00 p.m.
