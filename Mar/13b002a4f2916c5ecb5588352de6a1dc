The magazine will host its second annual Time Women of the Year gala in Los Angeles on March 8 to honour the line-up. In addition to visits by awardees including Blanchett, Siddiqa, Bassett, Brunson, Ali, Shevchenko, and Alinejad, the evening will feature a special performance by musical icon Bridgers. Along with Fiji Water serving as a supporting partner, P&G is a participating partner. “Time’s mission is to shine a light on the people and ideas that are making the world a better place. The 2023 Time Women of the Year are leading us all toward a more equal world and affecting real change through their efforts and commitments to climate activism, human rights, social justice, and more,” offered Time CEO Jessica Sibley. As a strategy to divert attention from its Man of the Year franchise, which was renamed Person of the Year in 1999, Time initiated a project in 2020 to recognize 100 significant women of the 20th century. This effort was expanded into the Women of the Year list. The following covers feature two of the 2018 Women of the Year awardees.
