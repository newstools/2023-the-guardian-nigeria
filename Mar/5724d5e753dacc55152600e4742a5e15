However for many reasons we pause to take a sigh, most times we don’t do anything about them anymore. The year is very much young; do you need that extra push? Or that motivation to make you achieve your set targets this year? Here are our suggestions for you.
So how can you set goals properly? Reading some good setting goals books is a great place to start. These 9 books should push you ahead of the rest, and importantly, to make you achieve all your set goals. Creating Your Best Life
Written by Caroline Miller, MAPP, she takes the standard SMART formula for goal setting and goes beyond that approach. She makes a point of giving you specific exercises while also sharing related stories.
It’s a great book to consider as we connect better with stories and can find more motivation to set goals in the manner that Miller outlines in her book.

Your Best Year Ever Michael Hyatt is the author of this book, and he takes a research-based approach to goal setting. The end result is to set goals that are meaningful. To do that, you must first look at your own purpose.
The book applies to any kind of goal that you can think of. It also helps that Hyatt has field-tested his theories and results on people. This ensures that what Hyatt is talking about will help you in getting unstuck and setting up quit-proof goals.

The Book of Mistakes
Skip Prichard is a wonderful storyteller and weaves that skill into this book. This book takes a figurative person who discovers nine mistakes that highly successful people never make.
One example is where Prichard talks about the mistake of living someone else’s dream. He tells that story while explaining to the reader the importance of being able to think about who they want to be.
Even though the character is a young person, it’s surprising how much these mistakes can still apply to older people, too.

Hard Goals: The Secret to Getting from Where You Are to Where You Want to Be by Mark Murphy
Hard Goals are a little different from the others. It isn’t a step-by-step guide on goal setting; instead, he focuses on what he considers the four most important principles that make an effective goal. He uses the acronym HARD for those principles: H: Heartfelt A: Animated R: Required D: Difficult
He discusses the importance of choosing a goal that you are passionate about – if you aren’t passionate about it, you likely won’t put the effort into it to make it happen.
With animation, he emphasizes the importance of making your goals vivid and real in your mind. He says that even before you write your goal, you should be visualizing and seeing your end result, what you want.
Difficult is difficult to explain – just kidding. With difficulty, he explains the importance of setting challenging and difficult goals instead of easy ones.

The 4 Disciplines of Execution: by Chris Machesney’s, Sean Covey, and Jim Huling
The 4 Disciplines of Execution, or the 4 D’s as I like to call it, is focused on how to set great business goals for your business. Many business goals and aims fail and go nowhere. This book is made to help alleviate that.
One other important aspect of the 4D’s is the fact that you have to set goals top down and bottom up. The leadership sets the main goal, and those under create goals to help achieve that goal.

Measure What Matters: by John Doerr
Measure What Matters is another business goal setting book (that can also be applied personally). The system is used by many big-name companies, such as Google.
It’s successful because it’s based on many of the same principles as the 4 D’s (and in fact, is very similar in many ways).
Your Objective is your goal, what you are trying to achieve. Your Key Results are the steps you are going to take to get there. Once you finish your Key results, by default, you completed your objective (or you didn’t write the right key results).
But it’s not limited to that. Google, for example, has normal routine OKRs that they expect 100% completion, and experimental ones, where you try new things that they expect to fail sometimes.

The Success Principles by Jack Canfield and Janet Switzer
The Success Principles is not a goal-setting book, per se. It’s about finding success in life. Part of that, however, is goal setting.
Canfield covers step-by-step the steps he believes you need to take to find success in life: from taking responsibility to overcoming fears to dealing with rejection to being around the right people and so on.
In it, he does teach how to write effective goals and steps to take to help make them real and accomplish them.

The Magic of Thinking Big By David J. Schwartz, Ph.D.
“You are what you think you are,” writes David J. Schwartz, Ph.D. in The Magic of Thinking Big. Exceeding your goals is possible when you believe in yourself. Get over the fear of failure and use the power of a positive attitude to achieve big things. “When you believe something can be done, really believe, your mind will find the ways to do it. Believing a solution paves the way to solution.”

Goals! By Brian Tracy
Author of dozens of books on personal development, Brian Tracy explains the 12 steps necessary to set and accomplish goals both large and small. The author emphasizes self-discipline and persistence and two keys to achieving your goals. He also encourages readers to clearly establish their goals: Write them down and be specific. Make sure you can easily explain your goal to someone else, Brian says, and know exactly when you have achieved it.
