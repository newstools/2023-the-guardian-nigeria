Four persons were injured yesterday in Gidan Ways, Jema’a Local Government Area of Kaduna State (Southern) as thugs attacked the campaign convoy of Labour Party (LP) governorship candidate, Jonathan Asake. The victims of the attack were two boys and two girls, while no vehicle was damaged. The incident occurred when the campaign convoy of Asake was passing through Gidan Waya during Friday prayers on its way to Godogodo and other towns for campaign. In a statement issued by Asake’s spokesman, James Swam, “After the first three vehicles in the convoy made their way through the old tyres used for the demarcation of the road, the thugs started throwing stones, big sticks and other harmful objects at the long convoy. “It took the timely intervention of the security personnel attached to the candidate to forestall the crisis.”
