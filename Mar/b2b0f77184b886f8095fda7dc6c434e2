The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), early yesterday, declared the former Lagos State governor as the winner of Saturday’s presidential poll. According to a statement issued by the Command’s spokesman, DSP Muhammed Jalige, “the Nigeria Police Force, Kaduna State Command, wishes to notify the general public that all forms of celebrations and rallies by political party supporters for or against winners/losers of the just concluded Presidential and National Assembly elections have been banned in the state.” He said: “Any deliberate act to violate the ban or cause breakdown of law and order, under whatever guise, will face the full wrath of the law, as security agencies have been deployed and directed to ensure full enforcement. “All persons with intent to violate the order are warned to desist, as the Command, in collaboration with other sister agencies, are fully prepared to deal decisively with such persons, in accordance with extant laws.” The Command also called on members of the public “not to relent in supporting security agencies to deliver their mandates of securing life and property of the good people of Kaduna State.”
