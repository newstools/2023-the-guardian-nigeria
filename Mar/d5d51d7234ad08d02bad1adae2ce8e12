â€¢ Organises workshop for journalists
There are fears that the 2023 National Population and Housing Census may fail in Abia State like past ones were alleged to be. The Abia State Director, National Population Commission (NPC), Lady Juliana Ezebuiro, and the State Head of Technical Department, Uduma Kalu, disclosed this during a one-day capacity building workshop on effective reporting on the 2023 National Population and Housing Census, which the state NPC organised for journalists at Umuahia, the state capital. He noted that unless demographic mistakes made in the state in past census exercises are corrected, 2023 census in the state might fail. Kalu said the state lost out in past census exercises due to lack of active participation of critical stakeholders, which, reportedly, posed and still posing serious threat to successful census in the state.
