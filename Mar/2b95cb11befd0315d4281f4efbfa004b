The Ogun State Police Command has arrested a 33-year-old woman, Ifeoma Ossai, for killing her 50-year-old landlord, Monday Oladele, after grabbing his manhood. The police spokesman, Abimbola Oyeyemi, said in a statement on Tuesday that the suspect was arrested following a report lodged at Sango Ota divisional headquarters by the deceased brother, Olaleye Taiwo. Oyeyemi stated that Ossai alleged that the deceased asked her to pay the electricity bill, but she insisted that she would not pay until the water directly connected to her apartment had been fixed. “On interrogation, the suspect claimed that the deceased asked her to pay for the electricity bill, but she insisted that until water is directly connected to her apartment as promised by the landlord before she packed in, she will not pay the electricity or any other utility bill,” Oyeyemi said. “This led to a scuffle between them, consequence upon which the suspect grabbed the manhood of the deceased and dragged him with it. “The landlord fell unconsciously on the ground, and he was rushed to General Hospital, Ota, where the doctor on duty confirmed him dead.” He added that the Commissioner of Police, Frank Mba, had ordered the immediate transfer of the suspect to the homicide section of the state criminal investigation department for further investigation and prosecution.
