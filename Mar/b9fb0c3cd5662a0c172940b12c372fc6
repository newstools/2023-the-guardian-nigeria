Nimrod donates softball to state teams Team Hasso Women’s Volleyball Club, at the weekend, defeated Team Tanimu 3-2 (25-22, 10-25, 25-22, 25-19, 16-18) to win the second Female Captains Volleyball Championship held at the Jabi Lake Recreation Park, Life Camp Volleyball Court, Abuja. Team General came third place. Speaking after the final game, a former national women’s U-17 player and Most Valuable Player of the tournament, Chigoziem Nneoma, said Tanimu lost to Hasso because they lost concentration and paraded a weak defence. Chairperson, planning committee of the tournament, Amusa Rabiat, said the event was organised to bring women volleyball players together to keep the game alive. She said the three-day tourney would spur many grassroots players to fight for entry into the national team. Director, Life Camp Volleyball Club, Abuja, Obiora Nwora, said volleyball stakeholders intend to push the sport up to the level of football in Nigeria. At the end of the competition, the Best Setter Award went to Mary Ishaku of Team Hasso, while the Best Spiker Award went to Lydia Daniel, alias Mangala. Amara Gabriel won the Best Defender Award, Uyoyou Udubrae won the Best Blocker Award, while Esther Dominic won Best Server trophy. For its efforts, Team Tanimu smiled home with N70, 000, while Team Hasso got N100, 000. Meanwhile, president of the Nigeria Volleyball Federation (NVBF), Musa Nimrod, has donated five softballs to each of the 36 states, including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). He said the gesture was part of his birthday celebrations, which he marked with volleyball stakeholders in Nigeria on Sunday. Nimrod stated that the balls were solely for developmental programmes in various states and would be distributed by the zonal representatives of the NVBF.
