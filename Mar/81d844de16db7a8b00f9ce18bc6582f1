Plateau State Police Command has condemned the shooting of a civilian, Mr. Nyommena Salah Badapba  of Tudun Wada, Jos, by an officer, Inspector Solomon Damak. According to the police, the circumstance that led to the incident does not fit into his professional calling , but was done out of vindictiveness which contradicts the attributes of a Nigeria Police officer. “ To ensure that the officer does not evade justice, the officer had been arrested, his firearm was recovered and he has since been detained for disciplinary action. “The Commissioner of Police, Plateau State Command (CP), Bartholomew Onyeka, has directed the Divisional Police Officer (DPO), ‘A’ Division and other officers to visit the victim at the hospital to know his condition and make arrangements for payment of his medical bills. “The Command assures members of the public that the Commissioner of Police is a responsible cop who does his job with the fear of God and therefore, will not tolerate any form of misconduct by any officer of his Command irrespective of rank. “As part of wholesome practice in the Force, the erring officer has been defaulted and his orderly room trial will commence tomorrow (today), the 6th day of March 2023. “The CP also assures that the disciplinary process would not be compromised and the outcome of the proceeding would be made public, “ Police Public Relations Officer of the Command,  Alfred Alabo, quoted the Commissioner as saying. He further urged members of the public to remain calm and continue to be law abiding as the Command is doing all within its power to protect life and property of all Plateau residents.
