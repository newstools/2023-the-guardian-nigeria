The Federal Government, yesterday, said it had begun work to address brain drain in the health sector. It said that exodus of health professionals was not new or peculiar to Nigeria. Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, disclosed this while inaugurating seven projects at the University College Hospital (UCH), Ibadan, Oyo State capital. The minister also said that President Muhammadu Buhari had laid a strong foundation upon which the health sector can continue to build resilient institutions.
He said: “The establishment of these purpose built facilities will improve the capacity to cope with the needs of our patient population in any public health emergency as well as in routine service delivery.” Earlier, Ehanire had presented a letter of reappointment as Chief Medical Director of UCH to Prof. Abiodun Otegbayo for another four- year term in office.
Otegbayo, in his remarks, said the projects symbolised the important steps the President had taken over the years in repositioning healthcare service delivery to Nigerians.
