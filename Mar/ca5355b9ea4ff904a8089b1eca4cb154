The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) Ibadan Zonal Command has arraigned one Odeleye Moses Oluwabukola and his firm, Beedel Strategic Investment Company Nigeria Limited. They were arraigned before Justice Mohammed Owolabi of the Oyo State High Court, Ibadan, on a three-count charge which borders on forgery, uttering of documents and obtaining money in false pretense to the tune of N9million. The defendant, according to an EFCC investigation, approached his victim, Ololade Desmond-Eke with a forged “Local Purchase Order”, asked for a loan of N9million, with an agreed interest of N495,000.00 (Four Hundred and Ninety-five Thousand Naira), under the pretext of executing some purported contracts awarded to his company across the country. EFCC said the victim discovered, after advancing the money to the defendant, that the LPO was forged.
