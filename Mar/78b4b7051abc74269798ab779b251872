To make cinnamon pita crisps, pita bread is sliced into wedges, brushed with butter or oil, and then sprinkled with a mixture of cinnamon and sugar. The wedges are then baked in the oven until they are crispy and golden brown. Cinnamon pita crisps are often served as a snack or dessert and can be enjoyed on their own or paired with a dip such as hummus or yogurt. They are a healthier alternative to traditional chips and crackers as they are lower in fat and calories. Cinnamon pita crisps can also be made in various flavors by substituting the cinnamon and sugar mixture with other seasonings such as garlic, herbs, or Parmesan cheese. They can be stored in an airtight container for several days and make a great addition to a packed lunch or as a snack on the go.

INGREDIENTS
2 whole wheat pita bread
2 Tbsp butter
1/4 tsp vanilla extract
1 Tbsp sugar
1/2 tsp cinnamon PREPARATION 1) Preheat the oven to 400ÂºF. Cut each round pita in half to make them easier to work with, then separate the two layers of the pita bread (use a knife to create clean edges instead of torn edges). Cut each piece of pita into 1-inch triangles and place them in a large bowl. 2) Melt the butter in the microwave, then stir in the vanilla extract. Drizzle the vanilla butter over the pita triangles in the bowl and toss until the pita is completely coated in butter. 3) Spread the butter-coated pita pieces out over a baking sheet in a single layer. Bake the pitas in the oven for 8-10 minutes, or until they are golden brown and crispy. Stir the pita pieces every 3-4 minutes as they bake to make sure they cook evenly and to keep an eye on the browning. Every oven varies a bit as do pita pieces, so base your baking time on the color and texture of the pita pieces, rather than a strict 8-10 minutes. They should be golden and crispy when finished. 4) After baking, transfer the pita crisps back to the buttered bowl. In a separate small dish stir together the sugar and cinnamon. Sprinkle the sugar and cinnamon mixture over the baked pita crisps, then toss until they are well coated in cinnamon and sugar. Serve immediately, or allow the crisps to cool and store them in an air-tight container.
