According to a statement yesterday from the Office of the President-elect signed by Tunde Rahman, Mbeki spoke on Thursday when he visited Tinubu in his Abuja residence on completion of the Commonwealth Observer Mission. The statement added that Mbeki noted that the election was fair and credible and asked Tinubu to make the entire African continent his compass when he takes over the reins of government. “Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa with a big economy. Whatever happens here sets the pace for the rest of Africa. We need a strong Nigerian presidency that will also focus on the African region. Your opponent will be looking for a smallest thing to throw stones. That is the way of democracy,” he added. The president-elect assured the former South African president of his commitment to further African integration and economic development and promised to work with Mbeki and other leaders of the continent in this direction.
