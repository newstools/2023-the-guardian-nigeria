Nigeria’s biggest boxing export, Efe Ajagba, is in line to make his debut in Britain this year after impressive outings in the United States. The 2016 Olympics star, who turned professional immediately after reaching the quarterfinals of the heavyweight division at the Rio Games, scored yet another win at the weekend, beating the previously unbeaten Stephan Shaw by 10-round unanimous decision (96-94, 96-94 and 96-94) at Turning Stone Resort Casino. According to boxingscene.com, Ajagba is now in the mix for potential fights against two highly rated contenders from the United Kingdom – WBA “regular” champion Daniel Dubois and WBO interim-champion Joe Joyce. Top Rank, who promote Ajagba, have a close relationship with veteran promoter, Frank Warren, who guides the careers of Dubois and Joyce. Ajagba (17-1, 13 KOs) won his second straight bout since a 2021 decision defeat to Frank Sanchez, which took place on the undercard of the Tyson Fury vs. Deontay Wilder trilogy card. He had surgeries on both elbows after that fight and has re-established himself as a contender to watch. Shaw (18-1, 13 KOs) was ahead 58-56 on all three judges’ cards after the sixth, but was outlanded 62-37 in the last four rounds. In a battle of jabs, Ajagba landed his with more frequency (90-48). Describing the fight, Ajagba said: “I went back to the corner and they told me to let my hands go, keep throwing punches, my jab. I controlled the fight, so that’s how I won the fight. “He tried to land the big shots. I watched him to see what he was going to do. He kept throwing the jab, using the jab more.”
