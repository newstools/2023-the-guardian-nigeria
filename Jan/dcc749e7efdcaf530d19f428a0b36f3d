The Event Xperience Africa is back for the third time and is set to hold from January17 to 19, 2023 in Lagos, Nigeria. Led by Nigeria’s foremost event planner and Founder, Zapphaire Events, Funke Bucknor-Obruthe, participants are intensively involved in an exciting, informative, immersive, inclusive and unusual xperience, engaging them on drivers for sustainable business growth, curated sessions, emerging innovations and trends in the industry. According to Bucknor-Obruthe, after a reflection on the success of the conference in 2019 and 2020 with over 1000 attendees from different countries in Africa and the progressive comeback from the pandemic, they are delighted to return for the third edition themed- “THE RESET”! and will feature a lineup of speakers from different countries in Africa and the diaspora. The event industry is an integral part of Africa’s growing economy and The Event Xperience Africa intends to build a legacy for millions of event professionals across the continent and build an ecosystem for sustainable businesses in the industry. “TEXA, I believe, will afford all attendees the rare privilege to learn, share and connect with other African event professionals and be better positioned to hit the ground running in the New Year,” she said. TEXA is expected to have in attendance event professionals such as event designers, concert and show producers, bakers/caterers, audio-visual experts (lighting, cinematographers, photographers), entertainment specialists (musicians/bands, dancers), event planners, wardrobe and beauty experts, among others.
