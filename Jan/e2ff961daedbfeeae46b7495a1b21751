Success John  He said, “I am very well informed that such do exist, going by some complaints I have received in the past. Regardless, I am not homophobic. Over time I have received a lot of complaints from friends and colleagues in the industry about how they were sexually harassed by some gay actors, directors and producers in their bid to get movie roles and become big stars. Some said they gave in because they didn’t have any other alternatives. And others that wouldn’t bulge eventually left the industry after so much frustration. Talking about the percentage level I wouldn’t know. As a core professional, I work with lots of people but I have never judged anyone or bothered about their sexual orientations.” Dr. Success who looks dandy and almost effeminate admits he has been taunted because of his looks and affluence, saying most men and women are not comfortable around him. “The very woman that introduced me to my top clients initially ignored me on our first encounter, saying I looked too flashy for a man. She accused me of either being gay or a terrible womaniser. The same thing happened when I came to Nollywood. Many actors felt intimidated by my looks. We live in a society where people think extremely cute and effeminate guys are gay. That’s not always the case, we have lots of macho, manly masculine men that don’t have any feminine attributes that are horrible gays. Yes, I said what I said. Some are even married while some constantly surround themselves with lots of ladies to avoid any level of suspicion. I have had and still getting numerous manly gay men asking me out on a daily basis on Instagram. I have many of them in my DMs telling me they love me and they want to get down with me. As a non-homophobic person, I tell them calmly I am not into it and am not interested. I do it with love and not by way of abuse and shouting. I cannot judge anyone and I have nothing against anybody,” he declared. Dr Success John who holds a BA degree in English is an Idoma man from Benue State. He speaks the Idoma language, Igbo and English fluently. He controls Infiniti Group as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Infiniti Empire Films which is actually a member of the Group.
