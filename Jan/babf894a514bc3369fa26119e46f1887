Sir: Media Rights Agenda (MRA) hereby call on the Federal Government to demonstrate a commitment to transparent and accountable governance by ensuring that all Federal Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) are provided with resources in the 2023 National Budget for the effective implementation of the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act.
 
Our analysis of the 2023 Federal Government budget proposals showed that out of over 500 federal public institutions, only nine entities made specific allocations for freedom of information implementation in their proposals, indicating that the FOI Act is likely to experience another year of dismal performance in implementation by government agencies.  • Maimuna Momoh is a programme officer, Media Rights Agenda.
