The singer has won the lawsuit against Celsius raking in the sum of $82 million dollars. The “Low” singers case was about his claims to have made the energy drink popular when he became the beverage’s brand ambassador in 2014. However, the energy drink company Celsius drink, assured that Florida had been compensated accordingly. During the events of the case, Flo Rida noted that in the early days of the Covid pandemic, he looked at his finances and past investments. Upon doing this the singer alleges that he discovered some big inconsistencies in regard to Celsius. “I check it out and they were telling me that one of the products I was endorsing wasn’t selling and I got a chance to look at it and it was doing more than well. This product has done over tens and tens of millions of dollars since I joined the company”, he argued. Following the settlement, Flo Rida also sued Celsius for company stock alleging it was guaranteed to him.
