A fuel-laden tanker, yesterday, crushed two persons who were on a motorcycle to death while overturning. According to eyewitnesses, the two riders on the bike were members of the Lagos State Parks and Garages Management who trailed the tanker driver to Fagbem Bus Stop on the Apapa-Oshodi Expressway. The witness said on accosting the driver around Fagbem, one of the two persons on the bike jumped on the tanker by the driver’s side, asking the driver to stop to hand them their money. He alleged that the driver refused, and so he started trying to take control of the steering from the driver. The witness said that it was in the process the tanker upturned on the boy and the rider killing two of them. The witness added that immediately after the tanker upturned, the driver escaped and the truck spilling its petrol content on the road. However, the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA) in a statement said it has responded to an incident at the Alaba Expressway area of Apapa-oshodi Expressway in which a fuel-laden tanker overturned due to a collision between the tanker and a motorcycle. LASEMA said the motorcycle rider was crushed to death underneath the tanker and its contents are spilling onto the road rendering the scene extremely hazardous to other motorists and passersby. “The agency working with LASTMA, LSNC, and Nigerian Police are working to secure the scene and carry out secondary incident containment measures while the heavy-duty equipment to remove the tanker is en route. “Residents are urged to avoid any naked flame until the incident is contained. Updates to follow,” the Permanent Secretary, LASEMA, Dr Olufemi Damilola Oke-Osanyintolu, said.
