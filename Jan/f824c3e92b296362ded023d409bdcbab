The Nigerian equities market reopened on a brighter note on the first trading day in 2023, as repositioning for the 2022 full-year earnings and dividend declaration continued yesterday. The bullish mood pushed market capitalisation to N28 trillion. The all-share index (ASI) of the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) rose by 344.6 absolute points, representing a gain of 0.67 per cent to close at 51,595.66 points. Accordingly, investors gained N188 billion in value as market capitalisation went up to N28.103 trillion. The upturn was impacted by gains recorded in medium and large capitalised stocks, amongst which are BUA Foods, Fidson Healthcare, PZ Cussons Nigeria, United Bank for Africa (UBA) and Nigerian Aviation Handling Company (NAHCO). Analysts at United Capital anticipated the robust market activity and bullish sentiments to continue. “The usual January momentum is likely to dominate particularly as the yield environment appears to be shifting downwards,” it said. Vetiva Dealings and Brokerage said: “Most of the Tier-I banks (UBA, ACCESSCORP, FBNH, and GTCO) closed in the green today, as these counters recovered given the profit taking seen on Friday. While we still expect mixed trading in the market, we anticipate investors to start snapping up names in anticipation of the full-year results.” As measured by market breadth, market sentiment was positive as 22 stocks gained relative to 11 losers.
