Forgive my assertions that came across as bigoted spewings against the Igbo  tribe, I did not mean to do harm, I am sorry!! .. — Ọláwálé Ọlọ́fọ̀ọrọ̀ (@BrymOlawale) January 16, 2023  Brymo has recently been under backlash from the general public about his insensitive remark that the Igbo presidency is nothing but a dream as long as there is still discussion about Biafra from prominent people in Igboland. “As long as there (are) talks by prominent people from Igboland about Biafra, an Igbo presidency will be a pipe dream,” Brymo tweeted Brymo’s remarks led to an immediate backlash from the public, especially from the southeast region of the country and the supporters of Labour Party presidential candidate Peter Obi. A petition was issued against Brymo by one Charles Ogundele to stop the singer from being nominated for the 2023 All Africa Music Award (AFRIMA) and it has generated 28,000 signatures “His (Brymo) actions spark disunity and hatred in attention there. Preventing him from winning the All Africa Music Award would send a strong message to him, and people like him, that he can’t get away with such blatant ethnic bigotry,” the petition reads. Brymo, however, issued an apology statement on his verified Instagram account stating “I did not insult the tribe, I am sorry to anyone who it sounded as such to. I was trying to weigh into a very important matter.”
