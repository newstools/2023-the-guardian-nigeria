The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has directed candidates with biometric challenges during registration for the 2023 UTME to proceed to its headquarters in Abuja. JAMB gave the directive in the latest edition of its bulletin released on Monday. The examination body said candidates who encounter biometric troubles during their registration process will complete the process at its headquarters in Abuja where they will also write their exam. JAMB insisted on its “no biometrics, no exam” stance for all candidates taking the 2023 UTME. JAMB said all the accredited CBT centres have been empowered for real-time online registration. It fixed January 14 for the commencement of registration and April 29 for the 2023 UTME. It directed prospective candidates to register at only partnering centres or JAMB offices across the country. The board said any candidate who ignores this directive would not be able to complete their registration. “No CBT centre is empowered to register candidates with biometric abnormalities. Such would only be registered and sit their exam at the JAMB national headquarters on the last day of the national exam calendar,” it said. “No candidate would be allowed to enter the examination hall or sit the examination if his or her biometrics cannot be verified as the system would not permit or process any examination without biometric verification.” JAMB also asked candidates to create their profiles on its portal to avoid any delay during their registration process. It stressed that there will be no offline exemption or flight mode registration.
