Thousands of All Progressives Congress (APC) supporters from the North East region were disappointed on Monday at the presidential rally of the  Partyâ€™s candidate, Bola Tinubu who could not address them over an embarrassing sound system at the Abubakar Tafawa Balewa Stadium in Bauchi State. Both the President, Muhammadu Buhari, and Tinubu who were invited to the podium to address the crowd could not speak as the public address system failed to work. Supporters angrily dispersed while Buhari, Tinubu, Party Chairman, Adamu Abdullahi and the Governorship candidate, Sadique Baba Abubakar were seen leaving the scene for their waiting convoy. Details later.
