To tackle flooding in the state, the Bayelsa State Governor, Senator Douye Diri, has budgeted for the creation of a flood and erosion control agency in the 2023 budget. He added the agency would soon be inaugurated to adequately plan and implement the state’s policies on flood and erosion.
 
The governor, who spoke, yesterday, in Lagos, at the Lord’s Chosen Charismatic Revival Ministries event tagged, “Mgbidi Lagos Experience”, with the theme: “What God has determined shall be done”, said that he was at the programme to worship God and appreciate Him for all He did for the state in 2022, and all that He will do in 2023.
 
Asked if he was bothered about the crisis in the PDP, Diri said: “Today, I am here to worship God and not for PDP.”
 
Diri said: “We have budgeted for a flood and erosion control agency in our 2023 budget and we are going to constitute that agency for the implementation of our policies on flood and erosion. That is the step we have taken so far.”
