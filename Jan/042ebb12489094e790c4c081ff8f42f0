Yuletide celebrations in Ogun State became more colorful following the presentation of a truckload of rice and other sundries by Ambassador Olufemi Ajadi Oguntoyinbo, the governorship candidate of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP). The rice donations, which covered 236 wards of the state, were given to members of the party to enable them to have a memorable Yuletide celebration. Ajadi, while handing over the truckload of rice, expressed satisfaction with the level of commitment of party members so far, urging them not to relent until victory was served. He said the yuletide was for sharing gifts with one another and for gratitude to God for keeping His people. Thanking God for the life and protection of the NNPP family, he prayed for a better life for everyone in the new year. “I am excited about being alive and thank God for the grace to provide these modest gifts to our members who have been working day and night to see that we change the political narrative in the state. “You have all been wonderful, and this is just one way of telling you, thank you,” he said. According to him, the yuletide comes once in a year and provides a great opportunity for bonding between people.
