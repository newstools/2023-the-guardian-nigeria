Onengiya Erekosima is the founder and president of the Foundation for Peace and Non Violence in Nigeria. ln this interview with OBIRE ONAKEMU, he states that Nigeria must do everything to get a lot of things right in 2023, that the use of dialogue will solve the crisis of insecurity in Nigeria and that this young generation is beginning to understand that they are important and that they have to play their parts to get good leaders. To Erekosima, the Presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Mr. Peter Obi is the only candidate to beat even as he declared that Governor Nyesom Wike is doing great things in Rivers State. EXCERPTS: How do you see the political games in the country as 2023 elections are fast approaching? Honestly, Nigeria matters in this world to so many other countries and I believe that the world is looking towards the history that Nigerians will make. Our politicians must understand that we have no other country to call our own but Nigeria, and we must do everything to get it right this time! Do you entertain any fear over Nigeria’s unity and existence as a corporate entity as the level of insecurity rises? No. I don’t have any fear because I know that Nigerians don’t need any kind of help from outside Africa to do well. We have what it takes to end the insecurity and killings all over Nigeria and Africa. This insecurity we are seeing today is worsening for a reason, which is to unite us in demanding for a common goal, which is peace. For the first time in our country’s history, Nigerians are asking for one common thing, which is peace in the country and Africa. I told the world when we were solving the problems in the Niger Delta that our leaders did not believe us (Foundation for Peace and Non Violence in Nigeria). l firmly believe that dialogue is the best approach to resolving the insecurity that we face in Nigeria today. How do you see the outcome of the presidential primary of the major political parties? l do not like getting involved in politics but I hope a difference would be made this time, from all what I am seeing. This young generation is beginning to understand that they are important and that they have to play their parts to get good leaders for the country that will in turn make life more meaningful for the people.

Do you think the current crop of presidential candidates can fix Nigeria?
Yes, I really do believe, and that person, for me, is Peter Obi. Can you predict how Nigeria will be like after President Muhammadu Buhari? Nigeria will be great again and be peaceful for all if the government will let voters and their votes count. Do you agree that the Federal Government is the number one enemy of the Niger Delta?
No. l don’t believe that the government is the problem. The people are the problem, for not understanding that they are the ones to make their future (tomorrow) better, and that they are to be responsible for whatever happens in their region as a people. It is not the government but the people. What is your reaction to the Federal Government’s plan to scrap the Presidential Amnesty Programme? The Federal Government planned in 2009 budget to spend N3.1 trillion in that year (and most of this will be from the oil and gas) but less than 60 per cent of this was ever realized, no thanks to the violent activities of the militants in the oil region who wanted certain fulfilments. For years, the government has tried to subdue the militants, from Port Harcourt to Uyo, Yenagoa, Warri and so on. But the more government tried to fight the militants, the more oil they lose. Both the military and (government) leaders did not believe my nonviolence approach would end militancy. The militants said they were fighting for lack of economic and infrastructural developments for the region, but the government said militancy had always made it impossible to begin the much-needed development projects, a situation that brought Nigeria to the dreaded vicious crisis.                                                 At that time, the Federal Government needed funds to meet the needs of Nigerians, but the militants said the needs of the region must be met before they would allow the government to get oil from the region. To break the vicious circle, I floated the non-violence approach. The climax of the whole thing was my ability to reconcile all the warlords that were fighting each other, making peace impossible, and the eventual amnesty.                                                  I did this to persuade the militant groups to down their arms. The government and the world will be sorry if that war comes up again. Would you say the government at the centre is doing enough to improve the lot of Niger Delta? No, and it is not about just the Niger Delta, all over the country needs help. It is said that in the midst of chaos there is also opportunity, and that opportunity is in the use of the nonviolence approach. I’m still willing to help. What is your general assessment of governance in Rivers State under Governor Nyesom Wike? It does not require many words to speak the truth. Governor Wike is doing great in Rivers State. What are the qualities you expect from the next governor of Rivers State and what should be his priorities? And what about the next president? Any governor or president at anytime should love their people and have regard for human lives. They have to know that they don’t have a lot of time. There’s a purpose behind everything in life. So, I will say to everyone in government or not, just make sure you make your mark, make your mark in this world, be the strength for others when they’re weak. Do something that will make you a better person. Don’t ever dim your light. Do you think the clamour for true federalism will solve our problem as a nation? Asking for true federalism, in the midst of the insecurity we are facing all over the country, is not being done at the right time. Our problem is not whether or not we are practising true federalism. The problem is that we are not telling ourselves the truth, that we have forgotten that we are stronger together. God help us with the understanding! How will you end this interview? As I have always said, militancy can never return to the Niger Delta as long as I live. This issue of insecurity is about the whole country, and we don’t need help to end it. We will solve the problem if the government will listen to us. God should help us all and give us understanding of the time we are in.
