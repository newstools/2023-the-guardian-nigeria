Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Minister, Muhammad Musa Bello, assured on Monday that the Abuja Light Rail would resume service before the end of this administration in May. The Minister gave the assurance when he featured on the 20th Edition of President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration Scorecard Series, organised by the Federal Ministry of Information and Culture, in Abuja Nigeria’s capital. He said: “Another important milestone achievement of President Buhari’s administration is the infrastructure development of the Abuja Light Rail” “And many of you will want to wonder why the Abuja Light Rail is not working, it is not working now because of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.” He contended. Bello explained that “We had to stop the operation because as you know the light train system basically is a mass movement, so if you don’t have much sitting capacity many people will stand up and when you stand up you face each other. ” So, it was obviously very difficult to maintain a social distance but we are done with that all the carriages are here and by the grace of God before we leave it will resume.” The minister disclosed that about 12 stations have been completed while about five of them are under construction. ” These are works we do in the satellite towns because the structure of the FCT is that we have developed in the Urban area that is the Federal Capital City as well as development in the satellite towns. ” But the standards we maintain for infrastructure for the Federal Capital City itself is the same that we maintain in the satellite towns no difference whatsoever” the Minister stated.
