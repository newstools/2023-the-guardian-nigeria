Four policemen were feared killed, yesterday evening, when gunmen attacked the convoy of a former Imo State governor, Ikedi Ohakim. According to witnesses, Ohakim, who governed the state between 2007 and 2011, was returning to his country home in Isiala Mbano Local Council of the state, when the hoodlums struck around Oriagu in Ehime Mbano Local Council. A source said the former governor had appeared to be the target of a possible abduction or assassination. Ohakimâ€™s driver, however, managed to escape, following which the attackers reportedly bombed the vehicle conveying the policeman. Details remained sketchy, but reports say the former governor is safe.
