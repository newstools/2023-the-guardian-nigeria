The Enugu North Senatorial District Election Campaign Council of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), yesterday, met at its new office in Nsukka to commence its grassroots election campaign to ensure landslide victories for Enugu State Governor and PDP senatorial candidate for the district, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, the PDP governorship candidate in the state, Dr. Peter Mbah, his running mate, Ifeanyi Ossai, and other PDP candidates in the area. The PDP Enugu North Senatorial Campaign Council is led by the Chairman of the Board, Prof. Simon Ortuanya and its Director General (DG), Dr. Vincent Obetta. Members of the campaign council said they are determined and convinced that Ugwuanyi’s senatorial bid will bring immense benefits to the district in addition to remarkable achievements the governor has brought to the area in the last seven years and seven months. They said that the governor’s good works in the state, particularly in zone, speak volumes, and are selling points of his candidature in the forthcoming senatorial election. They added that the time has come for them to propagate the governor’s achievements in the district to voters ahead of the elections.Speaking at an event marking the commencement of activities at the campaign office, which coincided with the expanded Zonal Executive Meeting of the PDP, the party’s zonal Chairman, Michael Onyeze, disclosed that the party, after assessing the Ugwuanyi administration’s six years achievements in the zone in 2021, gave the governor a pat on the back, and asked him to contest for Senate in 2023 to consolidate on his laudable achievements. Onyeze stressed that the PDP zonal structure is convinced that Ugwuanyi’s legislative and executive experience, having served as a member of the House of Representatives and, currently, as governor, will be an added advantage to the fortunes of the people of Enugu North if elected to represent the district in the National Assembly in 2023.
