Now Vice President Of CAA The President of Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN), Chief Tonobok Okowa, yesterday, emerged the new president of Africa Athletics Region 2 at an election held in Accra, Ghana. Okowa, who is the chairman of Delta Sports Commission, beat Vierin DeGon of Benin Republic 9-6 in a second round of voting. In the first round, both candidates pulled six votes each. With his election as President of Africa Athletics Region 2, Okowa is now the vice president of the Confederations of Africa Athletics (CAA). Two other Nigerians, Omatseye Nesiama, and Maria Wophill, who were earlier reported to be in the race for Auditor and Council member respectively did not contest in yesterday’s election. The Guardian learnt that Nesiama, who is busy with his senatorial campaign for Delta South, did not show up for the election in Accra. Speaking with The Guardian shortly after the victory yesterday, Okowa said: “I am grateful to God and all those who made this victory possible. This will surely spur me to do more for athletics, not only in Nigeria but in West Africa and the entire African continent.” Former AFN president, Solomon Ogba, who was part of Nigeria’s delegation to Accra, told The Guardian that Okowa’s victory as the new president of Africa Athletics Region 2 was as a result of his record of achievements since he became the AFN president in 2021. Under the Africa Athletics Region 2, top African sprinters have emerged from its biennial, senior and U-20 competitions, including Nigeria’s Favour Ofili, Rosemary Chukwuma and Enoach Adegoke. The delegation is expected back in Nigeria today.
