• Urges Ondo people to disregard rumours of not being fit
• Farmers protest destruction of cocoa plantation by govt
Ondo State Governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, yesterday, revealed that he had for a while been battling with an illness, hence his recent frail look. Akeredolu, while speaking on the insinuations making the rounds that he is gravely ill with a life-threatening illness, said that he had been recovering, insisting that his health has not in any way affected his performance in his duties as the governor. IN another development, farmers and indigenes from seven communities in Owo council of Ondo State, yesterday, protested against destruction of their cocoa plantation by the state government. Some of the communities affected include Ulura, Amurin, Oronaiye, Bobakanle, Opopogboro, Ago Adafin, Umoodun and others in Owo. The aggrieved farmers appealed to Governor Akeredolu and the state’s Commissioner for Infrastructure, Land and Housing, Raimi Aminu, to urgently intervene. A community leader, Chief Yahaya Oranaye of Owo and Adewale Owolabi Olura in a statement, said: “We are in a difficult position on this matter. I can bet that the government never paid compensation to us (landowners). The government only did enumeration, which even confirmed that we are the owners of the land.” “If we don’t handle this matter very well and urgently, it may lead to serious avoidable crises. Our lands were taken, we have no other place to go; we are not paid compensation.”
