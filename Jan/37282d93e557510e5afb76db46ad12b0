Kwara State Police Command has confirmed the kidnap of four tipper lorry drivers from a farm on the outskirts of Ilorin, Kwara State capital. The four drivers, according to sources corroborated by the police, were abducted by men, dressed in military uniform at a site, where they went to collect sand to supply to their customers last Saturday. The four victims, the sources said, were members of the Oyun garage branch of the Association of Quarry and Sand Dealers, Ilorin. The kidnappers, who later contacted their families, placed a ransom of N5 million on each of the four drivers. However, it was gathered that some women who claimed to be wives of the drivers, yesterday, in the Oyun area of Sango-Kwara State Polytechnic road, Ilorin were seen begging for alms from commuters and passersby to raise money to pay the N20 million ransom.
