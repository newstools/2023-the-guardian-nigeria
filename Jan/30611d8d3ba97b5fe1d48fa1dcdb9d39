 Crown Hill Professor Femi Osofisan, one of Africa’s foremost dramatists, theatre director, actor, critic, poet, novelist, editor and newspaper columnist,  recently, paid an unscheduled visit to the new Vice–Chancellor (VC) of Crown-Hill University (CHU), Prof. Jeleel Ojuade. The visit was a cocktail of coincidences for Prof. Osofisan and Prof. Ojuade. Osofisan’s first visit to Ilorin, this year, happened to be Ojuade’s first day in office after his inauguration on Monday, January 23, 2023. The timing of his visit, again, meshed with the time an expanded management meeting of Crown-Hill University was underway. It was an opportunity for Prof. Osofisan to meet with the management team of Crown-Hill University.  It also offered a platform for him to meet with Prof S. I.O. Ojo, the Dean of Sciences at CHU, with whom he had attended the same secondary school. Osofisan leveraged on the moment to solicit the support of the expanded management and entire staff of CHU in ensuring the new VC succeeds. He also counselled and admonished Ojuade to provide an exemplary leadership to move the university into global reckoning.
