Lagos State Police Command has transferred all personnel at Ajah Police Station. This is coming after two Nigerians were shot dead by trigger-happy policemen attached to the division. 
   
Spokesperson for the Command, Superintendent of Police (SP) Benjamin Hundeyin, who confirmed this yesterday, said the Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Abiodun  Alabi ordered the immediate transfers of the personnel.
 
“The CP has effected the transfer out of all personnel of the division, with replacement from other divisions. This would fully materialize in a couple of days. The new Divisional Police Officer (DPO),  Ajah, Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP), Adolf Ogwu, had earlier in the week dismantled all the shanties around the police station.
  
“We encourage more Lagos residents to, as usual, say something whenever they see something, as this would translate to a better policing experience for all. Remember, security is everyone’s business.”
 
Recall that Gafaru Buraimoh was murdered on December 6, 2022, while a pregnant lawyer, Omobolanle Raheem was killed allegedly by an officer of  Ajiwe Police station on Christmas Day.
