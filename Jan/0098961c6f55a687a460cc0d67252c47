With the high cost of diesel, fuel and epileptic electricity supply, it has become extremely difficult to run a business profitably in Nigeria. Energy cost is taking a huge chunk of the operating capital of manufacturers, rising over 40 per cent in some cases. In a recent statement, the Kwara/Kogi branch of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) said the skyrocketing price of diesel has made it almost impossible for businesses to operate. The branch Chairman, Pharm. Bioku Rahmon, in a statement, said the manufacturing sector was facing a huge energy crisis with a non-existent public power supply and a high cost of diesel.  He appealed to the Federal Government to urgently come to the aid of the manufacturing industry.
