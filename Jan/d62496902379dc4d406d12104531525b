Workers in Enugu State have appealed to the state government, for an improved welfare package in 2023 to cushion the effect of inflation in the country. Some of the workers who spoke with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Tuesday,  said their salaries can no longer  afford them some essential commodities. They commended Gov. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State for the payment of the minimum wage, adding that things are still difficult for them. They said that with better palliatives, their morale would be boosted and improved service delivery would be guaranteed. A staff of the Enugu State Ministry of Environment, who pleaded anonymity, said civil servants in the state are suffering due to economic hardship. He appealed to the government to pay leave and 13th-month allowances to improve welfare of workers in the state. “I am happy that work has resumed in the State today and I thank and appreciate God for seeing us through. “My appeal this New Year is for government to look into the salaries they pay to workers in the state. “They should also look at the issue of promotion and conversion and ensure it is done as expected,’’ he said. A staff of the Enugu Magistrates` Court who simply gave her name as Tonia said their majority challenge was insecurity. She some of them who come to work from their nearby villages to the state capital, find it difficult because of security threats on the road. “I want the government to add more money to the minimum wage to enable workers survive in 2023,’’ she said. NAN reports that work has resumed in the state amidst low turnout of workers at the Magistrate Court and the State Secretariat.
