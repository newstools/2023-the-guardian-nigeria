The Federal Government has reassured Nigerians that the general elections will go on as planned. The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, gave the assurance yesterday as he debunked fears of possible or outright cancellation of the elections over the high rate of insecurity across the country. The Ministers, who spoke at the occasion of the continued presentation of President Muhammadu Buhari’s scorecard reacting to a report credited to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) that the general elections scheduled for February across the country are under serious threat of cancellation due to insecurity. An INEC official had warned that “If the insecurity is not monitored and dealt with decisively, it could ultimately culminate in the cancellation and or postponement of elections in sufficient constituencies to hinder declaration of elections results and precipitate a constitutional crisis.” But the Minister insisted that “There is no cause for alarm” as according to him, the federal government is working with relevant government agencies to ensure high-free elections. “The position of the federal government remains that the 2023 elections would be held as planned. Nothing has happened to change that position. We are aware that INEC is working with security agencies to ensure that the elections are successfully held across the country. “The security agencies have also continued to assure Nigerians that they are working tirelessly to ensure that the elections are held in a peaceful atmosphere. Therefore, there is no cause for alarm”, he said.
