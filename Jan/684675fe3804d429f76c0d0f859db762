Dangote Industries Limited has clarified that President Muhammadu Buhari will commission its 650,000 barrels per day (bpd) refinery project before he leaves office in May 2023, and that the public will be informed and invited to the event. Anthony Chiejina, Group Chief, Branding and Communications Officer, disclosed this in a signed statement, yesterday, as he sought to clear the air on reports suggesting the President had commissioned the refinery during his visit to Lagos State. The statement reads: “Our attention has been drawn to some misleading reports regarding the commissioning of our Dangote Refinery during the current working visit of President Muhammadu Buhari to Lagos State. “We want to state categorically that our 650,000 barrels per day (bpd) refinery project was never part of the President’s programme on projects to be commissioned. “For the record, the projects slated for commissioning in Lagos State by President Buhari include: Lekki Deep Sea Port; 32-Metric Tonnes Lagos Rice Mill, Imota; 18.75km Eleko to Epe T Junction Express road; John Randle Centre for Yoruba Culture and History, Onikan; Blue Line Rail (Phase 1) commissioning (Marina to Mile 2); groundbreaking for the Blue Line Rail Phase 2 (Mile 2 to Okokomaiko), and MRS Lubricant, a private project in Apapa. “However, our refinery will be commissioned before President Buhari formally leaves office in May 2023, and the public will be duly informed and invited to the epic event.”
