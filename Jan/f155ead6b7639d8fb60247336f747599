There are indications that close aides to the former Governor of Anambra State, Willie Obiano, are in full support of the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate, Bola Tinubu, in the February 25 presidential election. Deputy Chief of Staff and Chief of Protocol to the former governor, Kagbue Uzuegbunam, who contested for the Anambra Central Senatorial District and Tony One-Week, who also ran for the House of Representatives for Idemili North and South Federal Constituency, moved round with Tinubu’s son on arrival in the state. Both of them contested on the platform of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) in last election and lost, creating impression that their principal, Obiano, has soft spot for APC. Speaking in Awka, the state capital, Tinubu’s son, Seyi, called on the people of South East not to vote against the party in 2023, as they did in 2015 and 2019, respectively. Seyi said he had earlier paid a courtesy call on Governor Chukwuma Soludo, explaining that his visit was to interact with stakeholders and youths in the state on the way forward for his father’s presidential bid. He expressed gratitude to the people of the state for the warm welcome, including the traditional ruler of Mbaukwu, Igwe Peter Anugwu, for honouring him with the title of ‘Nwannedinamba,’ urging Ndigbo to support Tinubu in 2023.
