Ondo State Government has extended maternity leave for civil servants in the state from three months to six months. According to the Head of Service in the state, Pastor Kayode Ogundele, the move became imperative in a bid to ensure total child development. Ogundele, who disclosed this yesterday, while receiving members of the Federation of Women Lawyers (FIDA), Ondo State chapter, in his office in Akure, the state capital, said that the extension of the leave period would help to build a society where children enjoy the required maternal care as advised by medical experts. The Head of Service said that it would afford mothers the opportunity to be more focused and productive when they resume work, adding that all the initial child-raising challenges would have been addressed during the leave period. He, however, lauded the complementary roles of FIDA to ameliorate the plights of women and children in the society. The state Chairperson of FIDA, Catherine Ogunjebi, advocated abolition of some seeming encumbrances in the administration of maternity leave for civil servants, irrespective of their marital status. She also clamoured for elevation of female lawyers in the service of the state to the position of permanent secretaries.
