Few weeks to Presidential election, Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State has reassured that the state will repeat what happened during the June 12, 1993 presidential election, when it ignored its citizen and supported a Southern candidate. He stated this during a campaign tour with the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidates for the general elections, as he visited the District Head of Kibiya, Sunusi Abubakar Ila, after holding a rally in Rano and Bunkure. The governor, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Abba Anwar, said: “That showed political maturity and dexterity of Kano citizens. We voted for Moshood Abiola of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and rejected Bashir Tofa of the National Republican Convention (NRC) because we all believed in national integration and competence.” Ganduje noted that the APC presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, had supported Northerners on different occasions to clinch the presidency. His words: “Tinubu was behind making Atiku Abubakar the presidential candidate of Action Congress (AC). He also provided another platform for Nuhu Ribadu to contest the presidency on the platform of Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN). “He worked very hard to maintain the equation; hence, his support for Northern presidential candidates in the past. One good turn deserves another. We have no other option now than to support his candidature.” The governor emphasised that Tinubu is being supported by the North because of his firm belief in nation building, human and national development, all-encompassing pedigree, among other factors. Introducing candidates vying for gubernatorial, senatorial, House of Representatives and House of Assembly positions, he said: “I am presenting to you all our most competent and deserving contestants, who cannot be mates to the contestants from opposition parties.”
