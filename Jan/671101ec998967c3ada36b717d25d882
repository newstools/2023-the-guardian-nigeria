• Yusuf insists rigid implementation unnecessary From poor logistics to trust issues and racketeering, efforts by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to continue with strict enforcement of the naira redesign policy have come under siege, findings by The Guardian have suggested.  In an interview with The Guardian earlier in the year (before the currency direction was announced), he charged the authority to urgently go after black money as a necessary action plan to stabilise the sliding naira. Yesterday, he reiterated support for the policy but asked the monetary authority to periodically evaluate the programme and bend when necessary. But Fasua observed that there is so much noise, preventing the authority from hearing those whom the policy could negatively affect. He noted: “Salary earners are not seriously affected.”
The illiterate, commodity traders and operators of the informal sectors, he said, are those who the CBN should be speaking with. Overall, he urged the CBN, saying it is time to keep an eye on the ball and engage other critical electronic payment partners, such as telcos, for possible infrastructure upgrade. 
    
While the CBN said it would stick to plans, a source informed The Guardian that the institution is under pressure from within and without to see reason. The source said there is “also overwhelming pressure from the political elite” but could not confirm with certainty how much the bank would backtrack.
    
If it does, it would be the second time it would adjust the programme to suit populist view. The weekly cash withdrawal limits for individuals and corporate entities (which came into effect yesterday) were adjusted from N100,000 and N500,000 to N500,000 and N5 million respectively in December. Meanwhile, banks are still paying in old notes, just as most automated teller machines (ATMs) are yet to be configured to pay the new notes. Also, conflicting reports on the directives have not helped the situation.
