Eroton Exploration & Production Company has confirmed a wellhead fire incident at the Akaso field of the Cawthrone Channel operational area of its OML 18 Asset last weekend. According to the company’s spokesperson, Mercy Max-Ebibai, the well is reported to be releasing hydrocarbons to the environment with wildfire due to suspected vandalisation and bunkering activity on the XMAS Tree containment valves of the wellhead. “An oil-ladened wooden boat was initially observed in the vicinity and a loud bang was also reported. This resulted in the fires drifting to two wellheads, only one of which is still aflame at the point of reporting. Akaso6LS fire has died out while Akaso15L is still on fire,” Max-Ebibai explained. Furthermore, Mrs. Max-Ebibai added that an Emergency Response Team (ERT) has been convened and the company’s well control engineers are working with an experienced wild well control vendor who has been contacted to carry out assessment of the current wild well fire situation, design a technical solution and fire fighting strategy. The spokesperson also confirmed that all regulatory obligations have been adhered to with the relevant authorities duly notified within the allowed window and that they are working closely with the relevant authorities to investigate the cause of the incident and determine the extent of the damage. According to the spokesperson, the safety and well-being of the company’s employees and host communities are their top priority. “We continue to appreciate the effort of the authorities, and the entire oil and gas industry to stem these incessant, unfortunate, and expensive incidents”, the company added.
