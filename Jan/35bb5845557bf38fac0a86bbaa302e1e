Traditional rulers across the 20 local councils and 37 Local Council Development Areas (LCDAs) in Lagos State, yesterday, declared their ‘unflinching support’ for the presidential bid of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate, Bola Tinubu and Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, who is seeking second term. The monarchs, who spoke at an engagement session organised by the Directorate of Religion Affairs of the state’s Presidential Campaign Council (PCC) at the Multipurpose Hall of Lagos Television (LTV), Ikeja, presided over by Director-General of the campaign council, Chief Oyinlomo Danmole, also expressed confidence in the leadership of the Speaker, Lagos House of Assembly, Mudashiru Obasa and other candidates of the party. According to Chief Ifasegun Opemolua of Ikate-Elegushi,  the league of traditional rulers and their teeming worshippers decided to throw their weight behind the party, especially its presidential candidate, in acknowledgment of the progressive leadership in Lagos State and Tinubu’s capabilities. He said the traditional worshippers had been offering prayers and sacrifices to the gods for Tinubu’s victory in the election. However, the traditional leaders used the medium to renew their demand for  declaration of August 20 as a public holiday for Isese Day. The party’s Chairman, Pastor Cornelius Ojelabi, commended the monarchs for pitching their tent with the party, saying that the endorsement confirmed their acknowledgment of the progressive leadership and governance the party had been offering since 1999.
