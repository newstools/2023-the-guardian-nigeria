All Progressives Congress (APC) in Rivers State has condemned the attack on its secretariat in Onne, Eleme Council of Rivers State by suspected political thugs. The Publicity Secretary of the party, Darlington Nwauju, expressed worries that despite numerous attacks on secretariats of political parties and members, there has been no record of arrest or prosecution. He called on the Inspector General of Police and other security officials to intervene, urgently, to forestall a situation, where people will resort to self-help. “Unfortunately, we have recorded such attacks, like the one we have just witnessed in Onne Ward 7 in Eleme Council, where the APC campaign office was attacked last night. “In the past two months, campaign offices of other political parties were attacked and campaigns were disrupted and even physical assaults on perceived political opponents have been recorded in this state. “Despite all the attacks so far, which were well documented by the police and the media, no single arrest has been made, no single person has been charged to court till date.”
