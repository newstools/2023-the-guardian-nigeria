Operatives of the Nigeria Police Force in Katsina State have apprehended a teenage kidnapper identified as Aliyu Salisu. The 19-year-old suspect was said to have led his gang to kidnap a six-year-old girl in Kano State and fled with her to an unknown location, demanding ransom for her freedom. The suspect and his team members, Abdulrazak Ibrahim and Mohammed Ibrahim, all of the same age, kidnapped their victim, Fatima Abubakar, from Bachirawa quarters in Kano on January 6, 2023. They were demanding the sum of N2 million as ransom from the girls’ parents before the Katsina State Police Command swung into action after receiving intelligence on the development. The officers arrested Salisu while receiving the ransom. His arrest reportedly led to the arrest of other members. The State Public Relations Officer, SP Gambo Isah, said the suspects would be charged to court after investigations are completed.
