The election is about 40 days’ time and I need to concentrate to face the challenges,” Salako said The former LP chieftain gave up his position, yesterday, to the state’s Deputy Women Leader of the party, Dayo Ekong. Salako stated that his decision was based on the directive of the national leader of the party, Julius Abure. Salako added that Abure told him to nominate his replacement as chairman, and he (Salako) picked Ekong because of her doggedness and selflessness in the affairs of the party in Lagos.
