According to her, she is doing well and does not have cancer but she was only misunderstood with her explanation in her first video clip on ‘Mercy’s Menu’. She stressed that she only had problems with her thyroid but  perfectly okay and does not have cancer. “Hi guys, Okay,  so first and foremost, thank you so much for all of you who have been calling and sending messages and prayers, thank you.  I do appreciate it so much. ” But, I do not have cancer. I noticed that a clip from my TV show, Mercy’s menu, has been flying around and I think they cut the clip. “I said I had a cancer scare, it means that I had this swelling on my neck and my doctors felt it was something serious. I had problems with my thyroid, I am perfectly okay. “Thank you so much for all of your calls and your messages, the phone has been buzzing like crazy, I am perfectly fine and I do not have cancer. ” I am perfectly okay. So thank you so much for checking up on me, thank you for sending those messages. “Go back and watch the clip, it was completely misunderstood, I am fine, I do not have cancer in Jesus name, thank you guys so much,” she wrote . {ad}
