Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain pulled no punches following Liverpool’s 3-1 loss at Brentford, saying the Reds “just weren’t good enough”. Monday’s reverse left the Reds 15 points off top spot in the Premier League, with their title hopes hanging by a thread. Ibrahima Konate’s own goal and Yoane Wissa’s header put Brentford 2-0 up. Oxlade-Chamberlain, making his 100th Liverpool appearance, pulled a goal back before Bryan Mbeumo sealed victory for Brentford. “We just weren’t good enough,” Oxlade-Chamberlain told Liverpool’s website. “We knew it was going to be a difficult game, we knew their threat around the set-pieces and we didn’t do well enough. “We got away with a couple with VAR ruling them out, but they were the warning signs and in the end we conceded a sloppy second goal after we sort of got away with that. “Then at 2-0 it’s difficult. I think at times we did well and we created some good moments but we didn’t carry on doing the same things that got us that success.” He added: “Brentford play their game and they play it really well, and we kind of fell into the trap a little bit. Overall, it wasn’t good enough from us.”
