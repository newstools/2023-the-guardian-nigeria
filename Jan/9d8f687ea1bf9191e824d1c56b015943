The Niger Command of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) says it will go after peddlers of illicit drugs to sanitise the political process before the general elections in February. Mr Haruna Kwetishe, the NDLEA Commander in the state, made this known on Tuesday in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Minna. According to him, the action is part of measures to ensure that drugs do not determine actions and activities during the general elections. This, he added, was necessary for peaceful, free and fair elections in the state. “Since the general elections are around the corner, we will go after suspected illicit drug abusers, peddlers and barons in Niger. “This is to ensure that the elections are conducted peacefully which will result in free, fair credible and transparent elections in the state. “Political thugs use hard drugs to enable them to commit electoral violence, therefore, we will not allow drugs to determine the actions and activities during the general elections in the state,” he said. He, therefore, warned illicit drug abusers, peddlers and barons, to stay clear of the state as the agency would go tough on them. “We want to sound a note of warning to all illicit drug users, peddlers and barons in Niger state to desist from the unwholesome practices. “We want to tell them that we will go after them until we arrest and prosecute them,” the NDLEA commander added. Kwetishe told NAN that in 2022 the command received two awards from the national headquarters of the agency as the best in drug demand reduction.
