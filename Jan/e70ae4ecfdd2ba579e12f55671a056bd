• British Airways, Ethiopia, Virgin, Qatar, EgyptAir, others grounded for 15 hours
• Aero Contractors, Air Peace cancel multiple flights, estimate N500m losses
• Protesting workers breach court order, says management It was complete chaos, yesterday, at the local and international airport terminals nationwide, as a section of aviation ground handlers embarked on industrial action in protest against alleged poor pay, which began exactly 12midnight.  Opeyemi later learnt that the flight had been rescheduled for 3:30a.m. (Tuesday).   The situation was not any different at the domestic terminals in Lagos, as all flights for the day were delayed, though for various reasons. Due to the strike action, Aero Contractors cancelled its Lagos-Calabar flight and delayed 6:45a.m Abuja flight till 4:10p.m. Air Peace airline also cancelled its Lagos-Akure and Lagos-Warri flights. As at the time of visit to the MMA2 terminal, Air Peace Lagos-Uyo 7:00a.m. flight was just boarding at 2:00p.m.
 
Air Peace management regretted the disruption, saying the airline lost about N500 million to the disruption. The airline, in a statement, said: “Neither NAHCO nor the striking union informed us of an impending strike. Our staff reported to work and noticed an ongoing industrial action. If we were informed beforehand, we would have conveyed the same to our passengers early enough.
 
“Now, all morning flights and other subsequent flights have been disrupted – cancelled, delayed and rescheduled. This has cost us over N500 million as we operate over 100 flights daily. Passengers are also attacking our ground staff as they cannot fly.”
 
The management of NAHCO had earlier blamed the protesting workers for the breach of court order and economic sabotage of the air transport sector.
Group Executive Director, Dr. Olusola Obabori, regretted the inconveniences, with assurance that the dispute would soon be resolved.  
 
He said: “We understand the power of negotiation. The company, which has arguably the best welfare package among the local players in the aviation industry, will do all that is absolutely necessary to make its workforce happy even as it delights its customers.”  “This is actually a force majeure and all global airlines understand that bad days do happen. It is only here that some operators will quickly add up losses just like that. In other parts of the world that are even more organised than we are, their workers do go on strike over industrial disputes. This is not any different,” he said.
