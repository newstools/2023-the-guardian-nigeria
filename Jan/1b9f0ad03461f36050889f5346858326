We acted on court instruction, say Police
The Ojomu family of Lagos has called on President Muhammadu Buhari, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, and the Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Usman Alkali Baba, to intervene in a disputed land matter in Eti-Osa/Chevron Estate.
   
They want Buhari, Sanwo-Olu and Baba to caution the duo of Lagos State Police Commissioner, Abiodun Alabi and chairman Lagos State Environmental Sanitation Enforcement Agency (Task Force), Shola Jejoloye, for meddling in a land matter.
 
According to the Ojomu family, on December 18, 2022, some policemen allegedly drove away owners of an 8223sqm landed property and their workers from the site, while some of the workers were arrested on the claims that they were acting on directives of a bank.  Responding, spokesperson for Lagos State Police Command, Benjamin Hundeyin, said: “Anything that happens on that land is as a result of court injunction. To execute a court order, police have to go with bailiff. So, it’s not about the police. “The CP did not just wake up and decide to take anybody’s land, it’s illegal and he will not do so.”
