• We Don’t Get New Notes, Say Banks
 • We Have Given Waivers To Banks To Take Notes, Says Apex Bank Nigerians, particularly entrepreneurs, are worried about the failure of banks to roll out new naira notes, few days to the expiration of the deadline set by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).
   
The Guardian investigation revealed that less than 40 per cent of the banks are currently rolling out the new naira notes through the Automated Teller Machines (ATM) and on the counter.
   
A visit to some of the commercial banks in Isolo, Lagos, and Ota, Ogun State showed that several customers, particularly business entities, were lodging old naira notes on daily basis.  “The banks were being given slots, but now the CBN is bending backward to accommodate the demands of the banks in order to service them so that they can service customers for easy access to the new naira notes,”
 
He said that the apex bank was currently going around commercial banks to monitor banks and their Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) to ensure that they stopped paying customers the new naira notes over the counter, but through the ATMs.
 
Emefiele reiterated that the January 31 deadline for the submission of the old naira notes was sacrosanct, urging customers to deposit their old notes and not to be caught unawares.
 
On his part, the President of the Coalition of Associations in Computer Village, Timmy David, implored the CBN to ensure that the new notes were accessible before the deadline.
 
He said: “All ATMs should be loaded with the new naira notes. As we are giving the old notes, we should be able to take back new notes. If the machines are not dispensing the new notes, then it will not circulate.”
