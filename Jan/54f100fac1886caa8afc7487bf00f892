The former Speaker of the Ogun State House of Assembly, Tunji Egbetokun, has assured the people of Obafemi Owode Local Council of the state that the All Progressives Congress (APC) will win all elective positions during the forthcoming general elections. Egbetokun, who is also the Special Adviser to Governor Dapo Abiodun on Political Matters, said this, yesterday, during the visit of the APC Ogun Central Senatorial candidate, Shuaib Afolabi Salisu, to the apex leaders of the party in the council area. He said: “From all indications and based on the records of achievements by the APC in Ogun State, the party will win in every ward and every local council. Ogun Central will lead by example.” “ We will go all out to prove that the APC remains the party to beat in the state and that is why we are campaigning vigorously to ensure that we win all state and National Assembly seats, as well as ensure the re-election of Governor Dapo Abiodun for a second term and victory of Asiwaju Bola Tinubu as president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.” On his part, Salisu assured the people that he would provide vibrant representation for them, pay attention to their plights and ensure that the presence of both the federal and state governments is felt in the council, particularly in border communities. “I am not going to the National Assembly to mark attendance or join the Aye and Nay sayers, I am going there to represent your interest and I will be your voice. I will make Ogun Central proud again,” he said.
