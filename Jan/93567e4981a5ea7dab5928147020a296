District Governor (DG), District 9110, Rotary International, Omotunde Lawson has stressed the need for Nigerians to be more responsive to the needs of special and less privileged persons in the society.  We donated six wheelchairs and they were so delighted. The Assistant Governor, Ezinne Obioha also donated a wheel chair when she was moved by the joy of the victims,” he said.
 
Salami added: “We contacted them and they told us the specific type that they use, which is different from the ones used by polio victims and the rest. It was a memorable event and I was proud and happy because they were very happy. To them, wheelchair is life; without it, they cannot move around and do a lot of things. I am happy that we were able to impact lives in that regards.”
 
The Chairman, Spinal Cord Injury Association of Nigeria (SCIAN), Lagos State chapter, Abdulwahab Matepo, while receiving the wheelchairs on behalf of the association, expressed gratitude to Rotary Club of Opebi for the donations.
 
He said it was good that the association was consulted before procuring the wheelchairs for the beneficiaries. He also thanked Rotarians for the confidence reposed in the association by giving it the latitude to distribute the wheelchairs to those in need at their various locations.
 
“I can assure you that these wheelchairs would get to those who need them. We appreciate the gesture and pray that God would reward you and continue to strengthen you to do more,” he said.
 
Lawson thanked Matepo for effectively coordinating activities of the group and urged him to ensure good use of the chairs by members. She urged the members not to be weary and to keep waxing strong in the face of challenges.
