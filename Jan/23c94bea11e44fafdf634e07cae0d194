The Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) has called on Federal Government to conduct investigation on the killing of over 50 pastoralists around Doma, Nasarawa State, by a purported drone strike on January 25. According to the Northern socio-cultural group, it is the belief of Arewa leaders that only government has the power to deploy armed drones. However, the northern group said, in a statement issued by its Secretary General, Murtala Aliyu, at the weekend: “The circumstances surrounding the killing of pastoralists, who went to Makurdi, the Benue State capital, to retrieve 1,250 impounded cattle from the Benue Livestock Guards after paying a fine of N29 million to the guards, is suspect. “Sources told ACF that the drone strike happened while the livestock were being offloaded after the owners were forced to take back their cattle in trucks from Makurdi.” He pointed out that the incident came barely six months after a similar incident in which hundreds of livestock were killed when a helicopter gunship, belonging to the Nigerian Air Force from Makurdi Base Operation, carried out the strike, killing and injuring the animals, as well as herders in Awe also in Nasarawa. Aliyu further said: “In a serious country, the death of one person is enough to attract attention and intervention of government. Federal Government, through the Nigerian Airspace Management Authority (NAMA), manages the Nigerian air space. “So we expect the Federal Government to immediately fish out perpetrators of this dastardly act, whoever they are, to face the law. We, however, wish to commend the state government for the intervention it has made so far in giving medical attention and support to survivors and the victims’ families. “The ACF condemns this unwarranted killing and condoles with families of the deceased, as well as Government of Nasarawa State. We call for adequate compensation to be paid to families of victims.”
