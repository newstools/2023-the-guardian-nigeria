Seasoned journalist and sports marketing personality, Taye Ige, who is one of the sports personalities to be honoured at the upcoming Sportsville Awards on Saturday, February 4, 2023 at the Lagos Country Club, Ikeja, has described the honour as exciting. Reacting to the award, Ige, who is president/CEO of HS MEDIA Group, expressed pleasure at the Awards organised by renowned sports journalist and astute politician, Frank Ilaboya. “I truly feel honoured. I usually would turn down offers of so many of such awards because, as you know, they have become like half-a-penny. But the promoter of this particular one is a man of integrity. “He was my very first editor in sports journalism when I joined the Complete Communications Group in 1988. Everyone in and outside our professional circles attests to him as a thorough bred believer in hard work, honesty and diligence. So, I will whole heartedly accept an award from such a man anytime, any day,” Ige said. Former Nigeria decathlon champion and two-time technical director of the Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN), Brown Ebewele, will also be posthumously honoured at this year’s Sportsville Special Recognition Award. Others listed to be honoured include Bayelsa State Governor, Senator Douye Diri, Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, wife of Edo State Governor, Mrs. Betsy Obaseki and former Director General (DG) of the defunct National Sports Commission (NSC), Dr. Patrick Ekeji. Also on the list are the General Overseer of Mountain of Fire and Miracle Ministries (MFM), Dr. D.K Olukoya, basketball guru, Col. Sam Ahmedu (rtd) and proprietor of Naija Ratels, Paul Edeh.
