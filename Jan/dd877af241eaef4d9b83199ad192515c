Deputy Senate President and Delta All Progressives Congress governorship candidate, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, has raised questions over the sale of the Delta Steel Complex, set up with the sum of $1.5 billion but sold off for $30m under the supervision of the Peoples Democratic Party’s presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, back when he was vice president of Nigeria. It will be recalled that the steel complex, commissioned by President Shehu Shagari in 1980, was one of the largest steel plants in Africa, and a legacy project of the Shagari administration. Omo-Agege, on Thursday at Orhuwhorun, Enerhen, and Ugboroke, during the ongoing ward-to-ward campaigns, fumed at the sale of DSC, especially at the successor company, which he said doesn’t seem ready for business. He described the situation at DSC as unacceptable, because it has destroyed the economic livelihood of the area, and rendered the people even poorer. He promised to revisit the issue when he becomes governor. Omo-Agege also criticised the Delta State governor, Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, who is Atiku’s running mate, for selling out Delta State and the south, just as Atiku betrayed Delta with the sale of DSC. “We need companies to come here and create jobs for our youths, and I will revisit the DSC issue when I become governor. The era of PDP is gone; the era of Okowa and Sheriff is past,” he said, referring to Sheriff Oborevwori, the governorship candidate of the PDP and the current Speaker of the Delta State House of Assembly.
