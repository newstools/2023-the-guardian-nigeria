Labour Party (LP) senatorial candidate for Anambra Central, Victor Umeh, has said this year’s election is an opportunity for Nigerians to work together to elect competent leaders to pilot the affairs of the country. Umeh, in his New Year message, made available to The Guardian, yesterday, assured his constituents of his commitment to fairness for all Nigerians, if elected. He said: “There is, therefore, a compelling need to rise up and work together with one mind and purpose, to ensure that the February 25 elections become an opportunity for us to reposition our country by electing proper and competent leadership.” According to Umeh, of all presidential candidates, the LP candidate is the best man for the job, considering his track record and nationwide support. His words: “I make bold to say that Obi, based on track record in governance and management of resources, as well as far-reaching experience, is the most competent candidate for the presidential election. Fortunately, this opinion is shared by majority of Nigerians, considering the level of support and solidarity his candidacy has garnered across the country, especially among the youth.” “In about 55 days from January 1, Nigerians will have to decide the next leadership of this weak nation. I urge everyone not to vote for people who will further stagnate our progress as a nation, but elect only people who will heal it and move it forward to another level.”
