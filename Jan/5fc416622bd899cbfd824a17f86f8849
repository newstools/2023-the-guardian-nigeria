The Imo State Government, yesterday, described as cruel the killing of the Sole Administrator of Ideato North Local Council of the state, Chris Ohizu. It described the killing of Ahizu in cold blood as benumbing and callous. Reacting through a statement by the Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Declan Emelumba, government called on the security agents to arrest the killers of the sole administrator. “It is unfortunate that even those who are quick to shout over insecurity in the state never found their voices to condemn these cold-blooded killings in the past and are not saying anything also on the latest killing. “Be that as it may, government condemns this cold-blooded murder on a Sunday and appeals to the perpetrators of the dastardly act and their sponsors to resist the temptation of going ahead with this bloodletting, which has plunged the state into the current state of uncertainty. The government of Imo State is saddened by the brutal and cruel murder on January 22, of the Sole Administrator of Ideato North Local Government Area, Chris Ohizu.” He added: “Those previously murdered in cold blood include Orlu APC local council woman leader, Jenny Rachael Okonkwo (Iron Lady); Nze Chidi Ejiaka; Barr. Darlington Odume; Nze Nwachukwu Igboayaka; Mrs. Helen Nnakwe; Collins Okey Agah, Chukwudi Dimagwu; Eddy Ofuefule; APC chieftains from Orlu, and many others as well as Emma Mazi, former IMC chairman of Oguta local council. The government charged security agencies to leave no stone unturned in finding those behind the killing and prosecute them. It also assured that the government will continue to collaborate with security agencies to ensure protection of the citizens.
