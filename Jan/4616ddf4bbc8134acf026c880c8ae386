One person was killed while another was lucky to escape in a Saturday night accident caused by a fallen oil tanker in Mile 2, Otto Wharf bus stop, Apapa â€“ Oshodi Expressway, Lagos. The Lagos State Fire and Rescue Service said the incident was reported at 04:02a.m yesterday. The 45,000 Litres tanker was heading towards Oshodi from Apapa where it loaded Diesel to full capacity before it was reported to have fallen on a stationed towing van while on motion, negotiating its way out of barriers introduced by nefarious tolls collector activities. The accident, which was mitigated by the Sari-Iganmu Fire Crew of the agency from resulting in fire outbreak and secondary incident, however, left two male adults involved as one was rescued alive with injuries and taken to the hospital and the other recovered dead.
