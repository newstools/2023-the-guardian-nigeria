Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH) has begun training of all its cleaners in the cleaning department and other hospital workers on infection control.
Chief Medical Director (CMD) of the hospital, Prof. Chris Bode, announced this, yesterday, during a visit by Vice Chancellor (VC) of University of Lagos (UNILAG), Prof. Folasade Ogunsola, to the hospital at Idi-Araba, Surulere. The CMD, who stated that the ongoing training was very effective at different wards in the hospital, said: “I must commend the VC’s interest in infection control in the hospital. We are seeing tangible results as infection has dropped significantly in different places. We look forward to these kind of collaborations with you.” The VC met with all heads of departments to get first hand information on their activities and assured them of her maximum support and collaboration. She said: “Over the years, there has been drift but I am hoping that with my visit, we will start to re-establish how we are suppose to be.” It is very clear that the design was such that we are suppose to be working together and LUTH is suppose to influence what we do. So, I am hoping that in going forward, that relationship will be strengthened. Ogunsola also assured the hospital of the university’s continuous support and collaborations, especially in the area of medical research.
