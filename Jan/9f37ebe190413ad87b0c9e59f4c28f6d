Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) senatorial candidate for Abia Central District, Colonel Austin Akobundu (rtd) has stated that selection of candidates in his party for this year’s general elections was determined by their winning potentials and capacities, not only by their places or zones of origin. Akobundu, who explained this, yesterday, at Umuahia, the state capital, while unveiling his campaign manifesto, tagged,  ‘The People First Agenda Document,’ said that PDP is more interested in winning the election, hence candidates can come from any zone. Akobundu hails from Ikwuano Council, one out of the six councils that make up Abia Central District, namely: Ikwuano, Umuahia North and Umuahia South, Isiala Ngwa North and Isiala Ngwa South and Osisioma Ngwa North. The serving senator for the district and immediate past governor of the state, Senator Theodore Orji, hails from Umuahia North Council, but by rotation, his successor from 2023 is expected to be selected from any of the three Ngwa councils in the district. Akobundu said that he contested for the party’s Senate ticket in compliance with the PDP zoning arrangement, which zoned it to Ikwuano. He assured his constituents, whom he urged to vote for his election on February 25, that he would abide by his promises. He said: “My campaign is centred on citizens’ empowerment, human capital and infrastructure development, which shall drive stronger production of goods and services through effective legislation and oversight.” According to Akobundu, who was former National Organising Secretary of the PDP, he would want to be held accountable as stated in his manifesto, and described his aspiration as a divine call.
