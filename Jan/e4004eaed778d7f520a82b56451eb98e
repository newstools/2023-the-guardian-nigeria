The South South Coordinator of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Ward2Ward Group and Director General, Atiku/Okowa Campaign, Okrika Local Council in Rivers State, Onengiye Leonard Tamunoigbeinbia, said the issue of resource control and restructuring were the two challenges paramount to the people of the region. He maintained that only the PDP Presidential Candidate, Atiku Abubakar, could address the challenges facing the South South Region. Tamunoigbeinbia stated this, yesterday, at the South-South Zonal meeting of the PDP Youth Presidential Campaign Council in Delta State. He said that the PDP candidate would have a landslide victory in the South South as well as other geo-political zones in the presidential election while maintaining that “Atiku understands the pains of the Niger Delta people and can address them.” He said: “Part of the problems that bedeviled our country in recent times is the need to address the restructuring menace and that of resource control, which is paramount to the people of the Niger Delta and other regions in the country with natural resources. “For the first time, we have a candidate aspiring to the highest office in the country, who is willing to tackle those issues head on,” he said. He reiterated that the “South South Zone is PDP’s traditional fortress.” He charged the youths to be focused on the party’s victory and not to interfere in the activities or disagreements among party leaders, as “no family is too perfect and without periodic conflicts.” He tasked everyone to go back to his local ward and units to strengthen the confidence of voters in words and actions that are beyond sentiments or segregation of any sort. He stressed the fact that” our assurance as youths is in the experience and track record that our presidential candidate is bringing to the table of governance in Nigeria and nothing can stop us from moving with this gospel until victory is won.”
