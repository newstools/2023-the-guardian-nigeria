The Catholic Archbishop of Abuja, Most Rev. Ignatius Kaigama, yesterday, said that Nigerians are in dire need of anything that can inspire some hope in the New Year.
   
He said this is because they have survived an ever-worsening climate of fear and uncertainty in a time when the helplessness of government saw non-state actors unconscionably staked a claim for lives, property, and freedom of the people.
 
He added that in the outgone year, Nigerians lived with and survived a culture of kidnapping, hostage taking, and mindless murder, surrounded by so much bad news and associated with some of the worst scenarios.  He, however, stated that the determination to confront insecurity must be given priority in the agenda of those seeking to be elected, adding that they must have the will to unveil those behind brutal attacks and murders. Kaigama stressed the need to ensure that the spirit of dialogue governs the current political campaigns, just as critical stakeholders must ensure fair play and respect for the opinion of the people when eventually expressed when the ballot is cast.
 
He stated that having faced multidimensional challenges; Nigerians at this time of democratic transition need to fulfill their civic responsibilities during the 2023 general elections.
  
He said: “We are here today just because God has brought us thus far. The Kaduna deadly train attack in March and the agonising months the abducted passengers spent in the hands of armed men left us all traumatized.
  
“The daring Kuje Prison attack by Boko Haram and precipitated secessionist rallies left all of us begging for answers. The advisory by some foreign embassies on the risk of traveling to Nigeria and the subsequent arrest of suspected terrorists in October left us reeling in fear. The volatile situation in the Southeast in a bid to enforce an unlawful lockdown has made life in that part of the country difficult.”
