The statement read, “We received the sad news of the passing of our dear brother, Femi Adebesin-Kuti, Photo Editor of the Guardian Newspapers which occurred in the early hours of today with great shock. “We pray that God in his infinite mercy will uphold and stand by his immediate family and friends at this trying time as we sympathise with members of the Guardian Newspapers Chapel and the entire PJAN family. At every assignment he covered, his distinctness and dedication to duty were unmatched as he would always go above and beyond the call of duty to ensure every moment that needed to be captured never missed his lenses. As one of the notable photojournalists who honed his skills under the best, Kuti covered countless sporting events in Nigeria, Africa, and across the globe, notably the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) and the FIFA World Cup events. Kuti who hails from Abeokuta, Ogun State would be buried today according to Islamic rites.
