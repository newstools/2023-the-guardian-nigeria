Remo Stars of Ikenne were taught a bitter lesson yesterday in Match Day Four of Nigeriaâ€™s Premier Football League (NPFL) as Bendel Insurance of Benin put them to the sword. The Sky Blue Boys were sitting pretty on top of the table just before the game with nine points, from three games, and yet to concede defeat since the start of the season. Their clean sheet disappeared in the fifth minute as Imade Osarenkhoe netted the opening goal. Ismael Sarki made it 2-0 in the 25th minute as they led the game comfortably into halftime. As the away side was trying to come back into the game, Austin Ogunye sealed the game with the third goal in the 78th minute as the hosts secured an emphatic 3-0 win. The victory took Bendel Insurance to the top of the table with 12 points from four matches.
