Terrorists early Tuesday morning killed three people and abducted six others at Jajar Kanwa village, in Jibia Local Government Area of Katsina State. The incident occurred at about 2:00 am when terrorists rustled several domestic animals and carted away household valuables, including money, phones, and food items. A source in the area said that the terrorists came on motorcycles in their numbers, and were armed with sophisticated weapons. He said that the terrorists killed three persons, including a woman who worked at the local clinic in the community. The source said that scores of people sustained injuries during the attack, including those wounded by the terrorist, and those wounded while trying to flee. He added that the six who were abducted included a married pregnant woman and that the victims were moved into the forest by their captors. He said that before the terrorists left, they told the community to cough up the sum of N20,000 each for collection within one week, or face the consequences. He lamented that most of the people in the community were peasant farmers, and wondered how they can each come up with N20,000 each before next week Tuesday. The source, therefore, called on government and security operatives to come to their rescue as many of the community members were living in fear for their lives. A spokesperson for the police command in the state, SP Gambo Isah confirmed the incident, but however, said only two people were killed and three others injured. “Yes, two killed and three injured. Due to the ongoing operations in Sokoto and Zamfara axis, large number of terrorists – bandits are trooping into Katsina through Zamfara,” Isah said. “It was while they were coming in, attacked some villagers at Kanwar Jaja, Jibia LGA. Killed two and injured three. But no kidnapping took place. “I assure you that security forces are presently engaging them, rooting them out from their hideouts in the state.”
