Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer (MD/CEO) of The Spa Melori, Carla Sonjirin, commended the bank for creating visibility for SMEs and enabling entrepreneurs to showcase their products and services to the rest of the world. Sonjirin said The Spa Melori prioritises health and wellness, especially in a place like Lagos that is characterised by stress.

She described The Spa Melori as a wellness company that advises and treats clients on self-care, body treatment, massage treatment and skin treatment in a relaxed environment. Also speaking, MD/CEO of Eros Crafted, Ehis Eros, said the organisation of the fair by the bank is a welcome development for the growth and visibility of products made by Nigerians, adding that the development will help SMEs to improve their sales figures. Eros advised the bank to provide credit facilities to SMEs to enable them to employ more people and buy equipment. The co-founder of Zorkle, a clothing brand, Ahmed Akinsemoyin, said the bank should keep the fair growing and encourage other indigenous businesses to join the platform created for made by Nigerian products.
