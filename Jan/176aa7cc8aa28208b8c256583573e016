Delta State Police Command, yesterday, confirmed the death of two persons, including a councillor, who is also the deputy legislative leader of Warri North Local Council, Hon Bigha Grikpa, in a clash between the Eiye and Vikings cult gangs in Sapele area of the state. Spokesperson for the Command, Bright Edafe, told The Guardian on phone  that one person was severely injured in the brutal shooting and hospitalised,  though reports indicated that four persons were shot dead. According to him, Grikpa was shot in the left eye with the bullet destroying the eye socket tearing off a part of his face and he died immediately.
Grikpa was allegedly buying items in a fashion shop when the gang swooped on him and shot him dead. The owner of the shop was equally killed. Edafe said he would get an update to find out if the number of those killed had risen to four as reports indicated. He said: “We learnt there was a cult clash between Eiye and Vikings cultists, and that one of the cult gangs was searching for a particular member of the rival cult gang, and they mistook the councillor from Warri North council for him, because they probably looked alike, and shot him dead.” The police have launched an investigation into the incident, but no arrest has been made as the gangs are on the run.”
