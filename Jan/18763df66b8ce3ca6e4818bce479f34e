 Shatta Wale | Wuzup Nigeria Shatta Wale, a dancehall and afrobeat musician, has criticised Ghana’s music industry and appealed to Nigerians for support. The Nigerian market has not appealed to Shatta Wale. A few months ago, he attacked Grammy Award-winning musician Burna Boy while disclosing some of the musician’s murky business dealings. During their exchange, some Nigerians on Twitter flocked to his page to criticise him. Shatta Wale has taken a different turn in hopes of a beneficial music career as he looks for support from the Nigerian music scene. Shatta Wale wrote on twitter,“Is better we stop arguing with Nigerian Fans, promoters, etc and ask for help Me sef I need a record label. Ghana music is a disgrace Mek nobody lie you .. Shouts to Naija Ghana ppl too deh like talk with no action Yes I have said it ….” While requesting help from Nigerians, Shatta Wale called the Ghanaian music industry a “disgrace” and criticised it.
