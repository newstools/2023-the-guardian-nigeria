Oyelami said scepticism was her first reaction to the good news.
“I have been a victim of fraud. When I receive suspicious calls, I just shut down like I did. Now, I believe that I have indeed become a homeowner in Nigeria, courtesy of Globacom. I am still struggling to find the right words to thank Globacom for coming up with this unprecedented customer reward programme, which I have become a beneficiary of. I am most grateful,” the 25-year-old, said.
 
The ceremony was attended by the zonal representative of the National Lottery Commission, Mr. Kayode Ojoogun, representative of the Nigeria Communications Commission, Mr. Akinwale Akanbi, Nollywood actors, Bolaji Johnson Amusan a.k.a Mr. Latin and Tunde Usman while it was anchored by ace comedian, Godwin Komone a.k.a Gordons.
 
The Sales Coordinator, West Territory, Globacom, Mr. Akeem Yusuf, disclosed at the prize presentation ceremony, which held at the house address in Oluyole Local Council of the state that the “Glo Festival of Joy promo was initiated in celebration of our customer’s loyalty to the brand. It is in furtherance of our determination to continue to make our subscribers happy and fulfilled”. He said: “The company will not relent to provide more value-adding and life-enhancing products and services to avail Nigerians world-class telecom experience that they desire…” Ojoogun and a representative of the Nigeria Communications Commission, Mr. Akinwale Akanbi both noted that Glo had maintained the laid down standards of transparency in the conduct of the subscriber appreciation scheme which has given 20 units of houses, 24 cars and hundreds of power generators, sewing machines and rechargeable fans in the promo.
