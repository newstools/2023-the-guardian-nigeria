Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), yesterday, said it secured unprecedented 3,785 convictions across all its commands in 2022. The figure, which emerged from a review of the anti-graft agency’s performance in the outgone year, showed a 70.5 per cent improvement over the 2220 convictions of 2021. EFCC spokesperson, Wilson Uwujaren, in a statement, said the development represents a 98.93 per cent success rate in prosecution given that the Commission lost only 41 cases, representing 1.07 per cent within the period. He said: “As it was in 2021, the Lagos command of the agency recorded the most convictions – 765, closely followed by the Ibadan command with 573 convictions and Port Harcourt zonal command’s 567, while the headquarters posted 314. “The convictions secured by the Commission in 2022 are the highest by the EFCC since inception and sustain an upward trajectory, which began shortly after the emergence of the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.”
