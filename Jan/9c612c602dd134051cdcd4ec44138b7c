As part of their efforts to help bridge the gaps that prevent a rapid development of Africa’s creative industry, the pan-African organization, with its home base in Cape Verde, is supporting the AFRIMA project with key human and financial resources to help achieve its objectives. Noting that its support towards AFRIMA is in line with its operational philosophy, character and mission, Chief Executive Officer, Social Nation Africa, Samba Bathily emphasised that the combined efforts towards the 8th AFRIMA is in the interests of the entire continent. “Social Nation Africa shares AFRIMA’s commitment to showcasing Africa’s art and music in helping the continent write its own narrative. We’re excited to team up with a partner that is providing a platform for African artists to tell the stories of the continent’s progress and promise “Through our sister company Mansa Musik Group, we continue to intentionally commit to promote African artists and support the continent’s creative sector through content production in art, culture, music and film. “The time is NOW, to recognise the vital role that the creative industry plays in job creation and in shaping the African identity, and a strategic partnership with AFRIMA will allow us to contribute to telling the stories of the continent’s ongoing positive social change and economic transformation,” Bathily explained. Commenting on the development, AFRIMA’s Executive Producer and President, Mike Dada, said, “We have always mentioned that the work of rebuilding Africa is not one borne by political office holders. It’s left to you and I, every African, to poll our wits, resources and time together to help rebuild sector by sector. What we are doing with the 8th Edition will still be relevant even after 20 editions, because the effect on the creative sector is a cumulative one. We appreciate our partners Social Nation Africa and their sister organisation Mansa Musik for supporting the cause and giving back to the continent.” As the whole world gears towards the 8th edition of the All Africa Music Awards, AFRIMA, which will be held from January 12 to 15, 2023, African music lovers are encouraged to keep voting intensively for their desired winners, using the voting portal live at www.afrima.org and take part in the events on social media platforms (IG/TikTok – @afrima.official ; Facebook – Afrimawards; Twitter – @afrimaofficial; LinkedIn – AFRIMA).
