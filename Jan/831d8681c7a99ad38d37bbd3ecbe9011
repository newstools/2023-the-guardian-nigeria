A professor of Early Childhood Care and Education, Professor Esther Oduolowu has advised the Federal Government to be proactive in making Early Childhood Education services available for children from birth to four years and increase the budgetary allocation. Oduolowu made the call at the 511th inaugural lecture of the University of Ibadan (UI), which she delivered on behalf of the faculty of Education. The professor noted that though there is free and compulsory Early Childhood Education programme in Nigeria, it is only for the five-year-olds. The educationist pointed out that brains develop most rapidly from conception to age two and a half years and nurturing care is essential for children before the age of five years. This period, she said, is critical for not only intellectual abilities, but also social skills development. The professor lamented that Nigeria has the highest number of children with stunted growth and school dropouts, adding that the various policies that the United Nations Childrenâ€™s Fund (UNICEF) helped the country to develop have not been implemented. Oduolowu stated that high quality Early Childhood Education supports the social and emotional well being of the youngest members of the society and as such, government should set up a commission for it as this level of education has the highest number of learners compared with other levels.
