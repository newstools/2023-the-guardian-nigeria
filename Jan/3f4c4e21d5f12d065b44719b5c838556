Newly promoted, Bendel Insurance of Benin, yesterday, returned to top-flight league in grand style, when the team defeated Akwa United in the Match Day One fixture of the Nigeria Professional League played at the Akwa Ibom International Stadium, Uyo. Star boy, Imade Osehenkhoe, put the Benin Arsenal in the lead in the 37th minute to record the first goal of the new season of the abridge league.  The hosts, the Promise Keepers, threw everything at their visitors to level score, but to no avail, as the Benin-based team frustrated their hosts’ attempt to equalise. Insurance’s Ismael Seriki extended their lead to make it two from a close range in the 43 minute after Akwa United’s goalkeeper, Godgift Elkanah, failed to handle the ball. With this result, Bendel Insurance now tops the Pool A of the 23 NPFL table, as other fixtures of the group are yet to be played. Meanwhile, in the Match Day Two fixtures of the NPFL, Insurance will play host to Plateau United in Benin, while Akwa United will visit Enyimba Football Club of Aba in an away fixture.
