Precisely, sell-offs in the shares of Airtel Africa (-5.2 per cent) and Buacement (-1.8 per cent) amid bargain hunting in Buafoods (+14.6.per cent) and NB (+14.6 per cent) drove the weekly loss. Reacting to market performance last week, analysts at Cordros said: “In the interim, we believe positioning for 2022 full-year earnings releases and accompanying dividends declarations will continue to support buying activities on the local bourse even as institutional investors continue to search for clues on the direction of yields in the FI market. “However, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the weak macro environment remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.” Vetiva Dealings and Brokerage said: “AIRTELAFRI’s net loss of 5.20.per cent eroded the positive performance seen all through the week, as all sectoral indices except the industrials closed the week in the green. “Also, for the first time this week, the NGXCNSMRGDS index closed in the red, as investors took profit in PZ, Nestle and Flourmills while BUAfoods and NB halted their bullish run. We expect another mixed trading session next week, as investors take profit on recent gainers.” A total of 2,172 units of Exchange Traded Products, valued at N1.5 million were traded last week in 43 deals compared with a total of 1.308 million units valued at N6.536 million transacted last week in 31 deals.
