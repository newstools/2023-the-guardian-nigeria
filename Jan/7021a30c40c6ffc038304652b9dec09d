The candidate of All Progressives Congress (APC) for Ogun Central Senatorial District, Shuaib Afolabi Salisu, has urged the electorate to beware of political jobbers masquerading as lifesavers. Salisu, who urged Nigerians to collect their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs), said the coming election would enable people of Ogun Central elect a credible candidate with verifiable track records. In a statement by his media aide, Adetunji Adeteye, ahead of the flag-off of his door-to-door campaign and open-air rallies across the six councils that make up Ogun Central Senatorial District, Salisu said: “Our campaign is entering another phase next week and we are not relenting on the gains we have recorded so far. We are strategic about it and we are intimating our people on the kind of representation they should expect in the coming months. “Our approach is not pedestrian and the feedback from people has been satisfactory and we can boldly say we are coasting to victory.” He, therefore, urged the people to ask the candidates the right questions, saying they cannot afford to vote for individuals with questionable backgrounds and means of livelihood. However, while reacting to a recent statement credited to the candidate of the opposition People Democratic Party (PDP), Olumide Aderinokun, Salisu said he would not engage in any form of media diatribe with a drowning group of political neophytes who are still struggling to clear their names from unwholesome practices. He said he would be focused and play politics based on ideology, competence and credibility, adding that he is a grassroots politician with resounding voice that resonates with the masses.
