The film, which Madonna, 64, was going to direct herself for Universal Pictures, is no longer in development, according to media sources. News of the biopic was first announced in 2020 and has gone through multiple screenwriters. The biopic’s cancellation comes a week after the “Queen Of Pop” announced a significant world tour, raising concerns about the film’s prospects. “I have a very long script that is really hard for me to make shorter,’ Madonna said last summer. ‘I’ve been whittling away at it, but it’s like hacking off my limbs.” She explained to media sources when asked why she had made the decision to take on the project that she has “an extraordinary life” and “must make an extraordinary film.” Famously known as Material Girl she continued to say that, a lot of people were trying to make films about her. Most of whom she described as ” Mostly misogynistic men. So I put my foot in the door and said: “No one’s going to tell my story, but me.” The lead role had been offered to Julia Garner, who most recently portrayed the fictitious German heiress Anna Delvey in the Netflix miniseries Inventing Anna, according to news reports from June. According to reports, Julia outperformed a long list of well-known figures, including singers Bebe Rexha and Sky Ferreira, Mayor of Kingstown actress Emma Laird, Euphoria bombshell Alexa Demie, and Oscar nominee Florence Pugh. Leading actresses allegedly underwent a “Madonna Bootcamp” that included dance instruction and could last up to 11 hours per day. It was a “gruelling” process that included lessons from both Madonna and her choreographer. The news that Julia had been offered the part first surfaced in early June, and rumours quickly spread that the project’s working title was Little Sparrow. Madonna, on the other hand, was enraged by the project and repeatedly blasted it on social media. She insisted that she alone can tell her story further describing the effort of anyone trying to as a . Any other person “charlatan and a fool” who is seeking instant satisfaction without putting in the effort. In the past, Madonna has helmed two critically panned films, the dramedy Filth And Wisdom and the biopic W/E about Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson.
