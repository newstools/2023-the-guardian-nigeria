The Imo State Police Command has announced that an officer attached to the Oguta Divisional headquarters lost his life, at the weekend, during a gun battle with unknown gunmen. This was disclosed, yesterday, by the new Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), in the state, Henry Okoye. The Guardian gathered that in 2022, no fewer than 10 officers were killed by hoodlums, while this year, about five have died in similar circumstance in about 30 police stations and other facilities across the state. About seven officers sustained  injuries in the process. Seven stations were destroyed, according to the Command. The PPRO said the hoodlums fled due to the superior firepower exhibited by the police operatives during the exchange of gunfire. He hinted that the identity of the cop would not be revealed for security reasons, informing that security operations, including investigation, were still going on in the area. Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP), Okoye said: “Our operatives in the early hours of today engage some gunmen, who attacked Oguta Divisional Headquarters. “The gunmen fled the scene due to superior fire power from the Police. Unfortunately, one of our personnel whose identity wouldn’t be disclosed for security reasons paid the supreme price.
Security operations is still ongoing in the area, further details will be communicated to the public.” The Guardian gathered that Imo State was relatively peaceful until April 5, 2021 (Easter Monday), when about 2:00a.m. a group of unknown gunmen, invaded the Owerri Correctional Centre, on Okigwe Road (behind the Government House, and Imo State Police Command), freeing about 1,844, inmates, setting ablaze vehicles and structures. Some inmates later returned and submitted themselves to the authorities of the centre.
