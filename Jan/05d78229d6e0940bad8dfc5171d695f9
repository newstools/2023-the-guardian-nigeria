Osun State former governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, yesterday, returned to the state  to lead campaign for the presidential candidate of All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu and his running mate, Kashim Shettima. Oyetola, while addressing his supporters after attending an interdenominational prayer session organised by the party to herald 2023, said he was back in the state to reclaim his mandate and to also ensure the victory of Tinubu and Shettima in the state during the February polls. He, however, urged the electorate to visit the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to collect their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs). He said: “I am happy returning home. I wanted to come in gently and unannounced. That was why I didn’t announce my coming, but to my greatest surprise, you were already here in this large number to welcome me. I thank you all for your undying love and unflinching support. “God has revealed to us that 2023 is a year of happiness and unending manifestations. God doesn’t fail in His promises. This year is going to be a year of laudable achievements. We are going to reclaim our mandate. “God has made us to know that this year is for two victories. We will reclaim our mandate and Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu will be elected President of Nigeria.
