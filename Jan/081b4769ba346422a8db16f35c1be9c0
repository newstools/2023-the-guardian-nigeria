Fast-rising Ndidi Osaji and David Edwards, who just returned from the ITF/CAT West and Central African Junior Tennis Championship in Togo, are already showing why they excelled at the West African tournament.
    
The pair were outstanding on the second day of the ongoing Azimuth Shipping Lines Limited Junior Tennis Championship holding at the Lagos Lawn Tennis Club, Onikan, Lagos.  David Edwards, on the other hand, appeared jittery, at the start of his game against youngster, Oizen Ayoola. He dropped the first set 3-5, but the lad, who won one of Nigeria’s first matches at the AJC in Togo, stepped up his game in the second set, racing to a brilliant 4-1 lead before finishing the game with a super tiebreak 10-2 win.
  
As at the end of the competition yesterday evening, the U-16 boys and girls had yet to hit the court, but the boys and girls’ 14 had already reached the quarterfinals stage.
   
The competition, which served off on Monday, will end on Saturday at the Lagos Lawn Tennis Club, Onikan. The winners will be rewarded with trophies and cash.
