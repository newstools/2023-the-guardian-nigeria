Analysts are of the view that the Nigerian equities market would be a mixed, but promising one this year. They believed that fiscal and monetary policies, as well as improved earnings, would drive economic and stock market recoveries in 2023. According to them, the projection is based on market players’ expectations that economic recovery would be propelled by policy reforms by the incoming administration. Analysts at Cordros Capital said: “In the subsequent weeks, we expect the NGX to be flooded with corporate earnings as more companies publish audited 2022 full-year numbers, which will be accompanied by dividend declarations. “We believe this should provide a catalyst for buying activities even as risk-averse investors are likely to remain cautious owing to medium-term expectations of an uptick in fixed-income yields. “Overall, we advise investors to seek trading opportunities in only fundamentally justified stocks as the weak macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.” Vetiva Dealings and Brokerage said: “As expected, there was a negative reaction to Guinness’ latest numbers, where PAT declined by 54 per cent in its H1 ’23 period. “Hence, the 3.71 per cent decline in the stock’s share price. However, we did see investors buy up Tier-1 banks: Zenith and GTCO, while cross trades done at lower price levels in MTN Nigeria dampened market sentiment. “We expect to see improvement in market performance at the start of the week, amid a positive market breadth.” The financial services industry (measured by volume) led the activity chart with 454.7 million shares valued at N4.8 billion traded in 8,214 deals; thus contributing 60 per cent to the total equity turnover volume.
