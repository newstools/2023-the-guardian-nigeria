Artists in the United Kingdom (UK) are renowned worldwide for crafting woodwork with unique designs and impeccable quality. Today, these artists are well-known for creating furniture in any style imaginable, from ultra-modern to heirloom-quality antiques. They sometimes combine various materials, such as glass, marble, and high gloss, with traditional woods, such as oak and mahogany, to create one-of-a-kind pieces that will last generations. According to industry watchers, a newcomer is rapidly rising to the ranks of the UK’s top retailers. Producing modern and contemporary furniture in a variety of styles and designs since 2007, Furniture in Fashion (FiF) has steadily established itself as one of the most well-known and respected brands.
