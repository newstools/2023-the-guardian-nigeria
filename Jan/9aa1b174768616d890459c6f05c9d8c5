Again, gunmen Monday night invaded and set ablaze Afor Atta Divisional Police headquarters in Njaba Local Council of Imo State. The Guardian learnt that a section of the station was also in June 2021, vandalised, after two courts around it were razed down the same period.
 
A source told The Guardian that the hoodlums arrived at the premises in the night and threw in a substance suspected to be an explosive, which made it burn, while the officers took to their heels.  Consequently, people of  Njaba , who are now living in fear as a result of constant attacks on police facilities in the area, are  calling on government to provide  security in the area.
  
The source said: “Some people suspected to be unknown gunmen last Monday night went to the Afor Atta Divisional Police headquarters, in Njaba Local council and burnt it down with explosives. “They had vandalised it in 2021, after they had burned two courts in the area. This is serious. We do not know their motive in doing these things.”
 
At press time, spokesperson for Imo State Police Command, Michael Abattam, was yet to respond to the calls put across to the telephone line. He was also yet to issue a statement on the incident.
