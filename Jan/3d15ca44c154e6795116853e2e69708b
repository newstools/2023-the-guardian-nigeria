• Local refining is way out, says PENGASSAN 
• Govt using subsidy to blindfold masses, says Okon
• Declare state of emergency, probe on subsidy, says Omoijiade 
• Labour to resist presidential candidates calling for removal, says NLC Notwithstanding proposals and campaign promises to end fuel subsidy, organised labour have insisted that until the Federal Government provides buffers and alternatives for subsidy removal to work, plans against the removal would be kicked against.  Giving an alternative to fuel subsidy, he said rather than the government spending billions in the name of subsidy, it should look at issues like infrastructure, education and health, among others that could benefit the masses.
“In some states, fuel is sold at almost N400 and you are telling us there is a subsidy. There is no subsidy anywhere. It is just a scam. It is garbage in and garbage out.”
