A Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, yesterday, adjourned to March 20, a suit against Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor, Godwin Emefiele. No reason was given for the adjournment. The court had summoned Emefiele to appear, following an arrest request arising from a $53 million judgment on the Paris Club refund saga. Justice Inyang Ekwo made the summons in an application for garnishee order on October 20, 2022. The presiding judge had ordered Emefiele to appear, yesterday, as the hearing date for the matter. The order followed an application by a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Joe Agi, against Linas International Ltd, the Minister of Finance, and the CBN, through its lawyers, Isaac Ekpa and Chinonso Obasi, seeking an order directing the Inspector General of Police (IGP) to arrest Emefiele and bring him to court, alongside his lawyers. The court, on January 23, 2020, had ruled that Emefiele must appear “to be examined on oath touching the means you have or have had, since the date of the said garnishee order absolute, to pay the balance of $53 million now due and payable under the said garnishee order absolute and also show cause why you should not be committed to prison for default in payment of the said sum.”
