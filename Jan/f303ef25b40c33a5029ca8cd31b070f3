Struggling Salernitana, who were hammered 8-2 by Atalanta at the weekend, have sacked their coach Davide Nicola, the Serie A club announced on Monday. Sunday’s thrashing made it six games without a win for Salernitana who are 16th in the 20-team Serie A. Nicola arrived at the club last February when the team was in bottom spot. He generated a revival that saved them from relegation and earned him a contract extension. “The club thanks the coach for his passion and dedication (and) for achieving the historic goal of staying in Serie A and wishes him the best for the continuation of his career,” Salernitana said in a statement. In spite of their league position, the Salerno club are still nine points clear of the relegation zone. It was the sixth coaching change in Serie A this season. Bologna, Monza, Sampdoria, Hellas Verona and Cremonese have already juggled their bench.
