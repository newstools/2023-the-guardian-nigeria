Seven-time African champions, Flying Eagles of Nigeria, will take on their Zambian counterparts in two friendly games in the Nigerian capital city as part of preparations for this year’s Africa U-20 Cup of Nations.
 
The tour has been consummated, following a request letter from the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) on January 13, which met with the ready acceptance of the Football Association of Zambia (FAZ).
 
Through a letter dated January 14, 2023, Adrian Kashala, FAZ’s General Secretary, said the Zambian football-ruling body was agreeable to the proposal. The proposal for the tour includes FAZ flying the Junior Chipolopolo to Nigeria, while the NFF will bear the cost of accommodation, feeding and other logistics for the Zambia delegation. The two matches will hold on January 27 and January 30, 2023 respectively.
 
Free-scoring Flying Eagles have scored a total of 10 goals in two friendly games since resuming camp after the yuletide period – the latest being a 5-1 mauling of Galadima FC in Abuja yesterday.
 
Champions of the WAFU B U-20 Championship held in Niger Republic in May 2022, the Flying Eagles have been drawn to play hosts Egypt, Senegal and Mozambique in Group A of the Africa U-20 Cup of Nations from February 19 to   March 11, this year. Zambia, champions of the 2017 Africa U-20 Cup of Nations, which they hosted, reached the quarterfinals of the FIFA U-20 World Cup in Korea Republic the same year, before losing to Italy after extra time in Suwon.
 
In Egypt, Zambia will be up against Tunisia, Benin Republic and The Gambia in Group C, while Uganda, Central African Republic, South Sudan and Congo battle things out in Group B.
 
All four semifinalists in Egypt will qualify to represent Africa at the 23rd FIFA U-20 World Cup finals slated for Indonesia from May 20 to June 11, this year.
