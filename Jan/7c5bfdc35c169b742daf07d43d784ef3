•Claims Are Fairytale To Attract Attention —  Imo Govt  
The Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP) has called for the arrest of Chinasa Nwaneri, an aide to the Governor of Imo State, Hope Uzodinma, over the attack on the residence of the group’s spokesperson, Ikenga Ugochinyere. However, the Imo State government, yesterday, said that those accusing Uzodimma and his Special Adviser on Special Duties, Chinasa Nwaneri, of being responsible for razing down the country home of Ugochinyere, and killing three persons, last weekend, to stop such, alleging that the CUPP’s spokesperson is the architect of his litany of problems.
  
Last Saturday, suspected gunmen invaded Ugochinyere’s country home at Akokwa in Ideato North, where three of his relative were killed aside setting ablaze over 30 campaign vehicles in his compound. Ugochinyere is also the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate for Ideato Federal Constituency of Imo State.  Commenting, Imo State Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Declan Emelumba, in a statement to The Guardian, said that the victim is a serial accuser of the governor Part of the statement reads: “Ugochinyere is so inconsequential with microscopic importance in the political firmament of the state to warrant any attention, let alone violently attacking his house. At any rate, Senator Hope Uzodimma, the Governor of Imo State has been in politics for more than 40 years and has never been linked to any form of violence. “From the so-called Omuma voters register magic to all his insults on the governor and the current one, all of them are mere falsehood aimed at attracting undue attention to himself (Ugochinyere). He (Ugochinyere) has lived a life of falsehood and violence, the reason he is always afraid of his shadows.”
