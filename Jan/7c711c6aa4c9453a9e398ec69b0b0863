According to the bank, getting a FastCash loan requires no collateral or paperwork as it is available and accessible to salaried and non-salaried customers of FCMB through its mobile app and USSD platform. It takes less than five minutes to complete the application process, and the loan is disbursed instantly. Beneficiaries can spread the loan repayment for up to three months. So far, over 2.7 million loans have been disbursed via the FastCash platform since it was launched in 2018.
