• Freight forwarders kick as cargoes get trapped, police unleash dogs on them
• Buhari commissions $1.5b Lekki port, Lagos rice mill 
• ‘Lekki Port can handle four times Apapa, Tin Can cargoes’ An estimated N65 million was, yesterday, lost as cargoes got trapped at the Lagos port following the Nigerian Ports Authority’s (NPA) total closure of the facility and restriction of access to port users over President Muhammadu Buhari’s visit.  Speaking with The Guardian on the situation, the National Public Relations Officer of Association of Registered Freight Forwarders of Nigeria (AREFFN), Taiwo Fatomilola, lamented that huge losses are being incurred on the trapped cargoes at the port.
   
“They have paralysed the finance of the port for the past two days. The vehicles and trucks that have been loaded, that were supposed to leave the port since Saturday cannot leave.  MEANWHILE, wearing a flowing white agbada, like his host, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, President Buhari, yesterday, at 4:25p.m. commissioned the $1.5 billion Lekki Deep Seaport that will generate over $361 billions to the nation’s economy.
   
The President arrived Lagos 92 minutes earlier, touching down at the Presidential wing of the Muritala Mohammed International Airport at 3:33p.m. into the waiting hands of Sanwo-Olu, his deputy, Dr Kadri Obafemi Hamzat, as well as governor of Ogun State, Dapo Abiodun; Ekiti State governor, Biodun Oyebanji, as well as former governors of Ekiti and Ogun, Kayode Fayemi and Ibikunle Amosun, respectively.  This was just as he stated that the multi-billion naira project is a collaboration between the Federal Government and Lagos State government, as well as the private stakeholders.
 
He expressed joy that the execution of the project, which took off under President Buhari’s administration, was completed during his tenure.  Sanwo-Olu said vessels that will berth at the deep port would be four times the size of the vessels that berth in Tin Can and Apapa.
 
The Managing Director, NPA, Muhammed Bello-Koko, said the port will attract bigger vessels and more cargoes, as well as reduce the cost of doing business in this country, compared to other countries. He said the port will be more efficient and be a model for other upcoming deep sea ports in Nigeria, adding that NPA has already gone ahead to purchase the necessary equipment that will ensure safe and secured berthing of vessels. “While sitting here we already have interest from a certain neighbouring country that is already talking about moving their cargoes from Lekki to Kano then to the African country because they have seen the opportunity of smooth operations here and the efficiency,” he said. The Chairman, China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC), Mr. Tang Qiaoliang, said the port is a major trade hub in West Africa, which will improve the Nigerian port industry, ease the burden of cargo shipment flow, create employment, and ultimately promote international trade. He said the company sees the opportunity in Nigeria, and believes in its potential, which is why it has committed adequate financial investments and essential technology in the construction and operation of the port. Qiaoliang said under the framework of the China Africa Forum and the Belt and Road Initiative, the company looks forward to establishing long-term strategic partnerships in the infrastructure sector with the Federal Government. He said this will ultimately deepen the relations and cooperation between Nigeria and China, better serving the Nigerian people and its economy.  Chairman of Tolaram Group, Mr. Mohan Vaswani, said the completion and commissioning of the world-class port is an important milestone that will increase the economic well-being of Nigeria and its people. Vice President, Africa CMA-CGM, Ludovic Rozan, while speaking on the container vessel that berth at the port said, more vessels would call at the port in the coming week. He said CMA-CGM would operate and partner with other shipping lines to bring bigger vessels to the port. The Executive Secretary/Chief Executive Officer of Nigerian Shippers’ Council (NSC), Emmanuel Jime, said the council would not only monitor, but also ensure efficiency and quality of service going to be delivered at the port. THE President, thereafter, left the Lekki Port to Imota in Ikorodu, where he commissioned the 2.5 million metric tonnes per hour Lagos Rice Mill. 
The President arrived the venue around 5:30p.m. accompanied by Sanwo-Olu and Chairman/CEO of Nigerians in the Diaspora Commission (NiDCOM), Mrs Abike Dabiri-Erewa, among others. 
 
After the official unveiling of the mill, he was taken round the premises in the company of the Senator representing Lagos East, Tokunbo Abiru, the commissioner of Agriculture, Olusanya and traditional rulers, where he was shown the modern equipment and other facilities of the plant.
