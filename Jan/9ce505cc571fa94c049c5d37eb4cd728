 AVO TV now has over two million downloads in Nigeria. As digital broadcast platforms steadily worm their way into the hearts of television viewers globally, Nigeria and Africa have not been left behind in the fiercely competitive and innovative space. With the youths making up the vast majority of Africa’s population and their tendency to make the digital shift to over the top  (OTT) platforms, Africa has become the new prize for streaming platforms to grow their customers’ base and, to this end, hundreds of millions of dollars have been pumped into content partnerships on the continent by Global giants Netflix and Amazon Prime, and regional players such as Showmax. Despite this, AVO TV, a free advert supported television (FAST), has taken the lead in Nigeria by reaching the two million downloads milestone in January 2023, eclipsing global and regional giants with more daily active users than Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney+ and Showmax combined. Launched less than two years ago, in June 2021, the meteoric rise of AVO TV in Nigeria can be attributed to its business model which sees it offer premium content, such as Nollywood movies, live sports events, and over 100 local and international TV channels – including Channels TV, AIT, Bloomberg TV, Aljazeera and SportsGrid – available for viewers to watch for free. With plans to expand to Ghana later this year, the battle for Africa’s streaming market is no doubt in full swing and the winner will be decided by subscribers.
