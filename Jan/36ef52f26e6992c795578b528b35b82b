United States-based long jumper and current National Sports Festival gold medallist, Joseph Edafiadhe, is targeting a new Personal Best (PB) in the 2023 Athletics season. Edafiadhe, who won the long jump gold medal at Delta 2022 NSF, has a current Personal Best of 7.84m he achieved at the 2022 Commonwealth Games trials held in Asaba. His Indoor season will begin on Friday, January 13, at Texas Tech Corky Classic in the United States.
Speaking from his base, the Delta State-born long jumper, said that his target this year is to create a new Personal Best (PB). “I won a gold medal at Delta 2022 National Sports Festival with a jump of 7.70m, but I believe the story will change this year. With my steady progression, I want to pick a medal for Nigeria at the 2023 African Games in Morocco. I also want to erase Yusuf Alli’s 33-year-old national record of 8.27m. I want to participate at Paris 2024 Olympics Games, and I want to be on the podium,” Edafedhe stated. Ahead of Friday’s Indoor season opener at Texas Tech Corky Classic in the United States, the former African Youth Champion said: “I have prepared well and my priority is to stay healthy and avoid any career threatening injury. I already had a great build up season.  Now, I am just looking forward to my indoor season opener at Texas Tech Corky Classic. It is one step before the other for me. “Asides the 2023 African Games in Ghana, I am looking forward to participating in the World Championship in Hungary. This will boost my chances of becoming an athlete to reckon with in the world,” he stated.
