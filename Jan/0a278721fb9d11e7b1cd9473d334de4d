The crust is usually made with flour, butter, and water, and can be either a traditional pastry crust or a crumbly streusel topping. To make apple pie, you can follow these basic steps.
To make apple pie, you will need the following ingredients: Instructions 
1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. 2. Roll out half of the pastry dough and fit it into a 9-inch pie dish.
In a large bowl, combine the sliced apples, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and lemon juice. Toss to mix well. 3. Pour the apple mixture into the pastry-lined pie dish. Dot with butter. 4. Roll out the remaining pastry dough and place it over the filling. Crimp the edges to seal the pie. 5. Cut a few slits at the top of the pie to allow steam to escape. 6. Sprinkle the top of the pie with flour. 7. Bake the pie on the lower rack of the preheated oven for about 1 hour, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly. 8. If desired, brush the top of the pie with heavy cream to give it a glossy finish. 9. Allow the pie to cool before serving. Note: You can also add extra ingredients like raisins or nuts to the filling. Feel free to experiment and customize the recipe to your liking.

Roll out the dough and place it in a pie dish. Peel, core, and slice the apples, and toss them with sugar and spices. Place the apple mixture in the pie dish on top of the crust. Roll out another piece of dough for the top crust and place it over the apples. Press the edges of the top and bottom crusts together to seal the pie.
