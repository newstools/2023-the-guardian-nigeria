A Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Mr. Femi Falana, has requested coroner inquest into the death of a police officer, Monday Orukpe and others injured at the Trade Fair section of the Lagos-Badagry Expressway. The lawyer in an address to the Chief Coroner, High Court of Lagos state, Taiwo E. Olawanle, demanded an investigation into the cause of death of the police officer and the need to make appropriate recommendations under (Section 15) of the Lagos State Coroner’s Law 2007. Falana declared that according to the law, an inquest shall be held whenever a coroner is informed that the death of a person within his Coroner District is due to violence, unnatural or suspicious situation. He said: “Precisely on August 3, 2022, it was alleged that about thirty Privates of the Nigerian Army while on transit at the Trade Fair section of the ever-busy Lagos-Badagry Expressway attacked five policemen for stopping vehicles along their lane to pave way for other vehicles to pass.  Angered by this development, the soldiers heavily descended on the senior officer leading the team of policemen and eventually murdered one Inspector Monday Orukpe and injured four others.” Falana said if not for the maturity and skill of officers of the Nigeria Police Force involved, the event would have left many injured and killed innocent civilians going about their daily activities. He added: “Having regard to the avoidable tragic incident, we humbly request you to use your good offices to conduct a thorough investigation into this allegation and fish out the members of the Nigerian Army who carried out this uncivilised act on the personnel of a sister security agency carrying out their constitutional mandates.”
