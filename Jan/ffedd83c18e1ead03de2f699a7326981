In furtherance of the preparations for the 2023 General Election, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), has received the last consignment of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) machines with 52 days to the election. A statement yesterday by the National Commissioner and Chairman Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, said the Commissionâ€™s Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, National Commissioners and senior officials of the Commission were at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, to receive the BVAS machines. Officials of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), the Nigerian Aviation Handling Company (NAHCO) and airport security officials were also at the airport to receive the INEC team. To facilitate the smooth delivery of the machines, Okoye said the Commission created four airport hubs in Abuja, Kano, Lagos, and Port Harcourt. Over the last four months, several flights delivered the BVAS machines to the designated airports for movement to states of the federation ahead of the elections. With the arrival of the last flight in Abuja on Tuesday, the Commission has now taken delivery of the required number of the BVAS machines for all the polling units in the country and extra machines in line with our contingency provisions for all critical election materials. The Commission appreciates the support of all Nigerians in its determination to conduct free, fair, credible, transparent, and inclusive 2023 General Election facilitated by the deployment of technology.
