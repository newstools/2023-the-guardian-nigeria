 A contoured face Face contouring is a makeup technique used to enhance or define certain features of the face. This technique uses shading and highlighting to enhance and define the natural structure of the face. It is done by applying makeup in a specific way to create the illusion of shadows and highlights giving off the illusion of a more chiselled jawline, a smaller nose, or a more prominent cheekbone.  Hence the face appears more sculpted and defined. Here are 12 tips to face contour-like ways to a pro:
Powder: Use a contouring powder or cream that is one or two shades darker than your natural skin tone. Application: Apply the contour product under the cheekbones, along the jawline, and on the sides of the nose.
Brush type: Use a fluffy brush to blend the contour product seamlessly into the skin making it have a natural look. Highlight: Apply a highlighting product to the points of the face such as top of the cheekbones, down the center of the nose which is the bridge, and on the cupid’s bow. Use a smaller brush to blend the highlight product into the skin. Again, use a fan brush to apply highlighter for a more subtle look and a translucent powder to set the contour and highlight for a natural finish.
Still on highlight, use a setting powder to set the contour and highlight for a long-lasting finish. Finish up by applying a bronzer to the perimeter of the face for a sun-kissed look. This time use a fluffy brush to blend the bronzer for a natural look. Desired look: Use a powder contour for a natural look and a cream contour for a more dramatic look. Apply contour and highlight products before foundation for a more natural look.  Apply contour and highlight products after foundation for a more defined look. Use a setting powder to set the contour and highlight products in
place. Use a small amount of product and build it up as needed. Finish: Use a matte finish for a natural look and a shimmer finish for a more dramatic look experimenting with different shades of contour and highlight to find the perfect match for your skin tone.
