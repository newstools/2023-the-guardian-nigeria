Top Nigerian celebrity stylist, DeAngelicTouchStylist, has narrated how he figured out the cloth measurement of a raving American singer, Jonathan Lyndale Kirk, a.k.a. DaBaby. DeAngelicTouchStylist<br />  DeAngelicTouchStylist, who later met with DaBaby as he travelled down to Lagos to meet with his host, Davido, said what he went through in accomplishing his task of styling DaBaby and Davido in their musical collaboration was a test of experience. According to him, “This project is a very special one and I am so happy it came out beautiful. I remember getting the call on a Friday and as of Saturday I still wasn’t certain that the shoot will hold. “I sent my styling reference on Sunday afternoon, it got approved by Sunday night. Which meant that I had just Monday to plan and put all the outfits together, the shoot was for the following day, Tuesday,” DeAngelicTouchStylist said. Narrating further his experience, he said: “An interesting thing was me not having any size or measurement to work with for DaBaby. Of course, I already had Davido’s size, so I went to at DaNaby’s social media page to look at all his pictures on Instagram. “That was when I even noticed he wears a lot of hats. I was a bit concerned because these are two big artists from different countries. “Tuesday came and it was straight to the location in Lagos lsland- there was no time for fittings. Lagos Island was super hectic. Probably one of the most stressful street shoots I have done in a long time. While set up was going on the second day of the shoot, I quickly went to DaBaby’s hotel to run fittings on the looks and everything came out beautifully and accurately. He loved all the outfits, no amendments done just straight to set to shoot,” DeAngelicTouchStylist said. DeAngelicTouchStylist whose work has earned him local and international accolades as Nigeria highly rated celebrity stylist said his stunts with DaBaby have added more to his experience, and today, he said he was happy to be rated more than competitors in the industry.
