After being waived by the Sacramento Kings earlier this month, Chima Moneke will resume his basketball career with AS Monaco, according to Eurohoops. The 27-year-old small forward has signed a contract with the EuroLeague club that will run through the end of the 2023/24 season, according to www.hoopsrumors.com. “I chose Monaco because the coach, the general manager, and the president showed a great interest in me directly,” Moneke said. “I felt wanted by the club and they thought I could really contribute to this team. They immediately seduced me and in addition, the objectives are high. The idea of ​​living in Monaco also appealed to me enormously, I want to live a peaceful and happy life.” Moneke was a star in Europe for four seasons before signing with Sacramento in July. He only appeared in two NBA games, scoring two points in eight total minutes, and spent most of his time with the Kings’ G League affiliate in Stockton. Moneke was released January 6, shortly before his contract would have been guaranteed for the rest of the season. He received $500, 000 during his time with Sacramento.
