Speaking at the ceremony of receiving the letter of credence of Mohammed Maiga, the new Malian Ambassador, Ebrahim Raisi said, “After the victory of the Islamic Revolution, the Islamic Republic of Iran has pursued the development of relations with African countries”. While condemning the policy of Western governments towards African countries, Raisi stated that the Westerners did not come to this continent to help, but to colonise and plunder the wealth of African people, adding, “We believe that African countries, with regard to their rich reserves and resources, as well as human resources, will be able to achieve more development and progress through independence without the interference of Westerners”. The President stated that the presence of Westerners in different parts of the world does not bring about security, but also disrupts security, and added, “We hope that the new government of Mali will take great steps towards independence and development with the help of the people of the country”. Raisi also said, “Considering the huge capacities of Iran, we are ready to increase our economic relations with various African countries, including Mali”. Mohammed Maiga, the new Ambassador of Mali, praised the economic progress of the Islamic Republic of Iran and said, “In the scientific and political circles of Africa, Iran is known as one of the emerging economies, and from this point of view, we want to strengthen relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran”.
