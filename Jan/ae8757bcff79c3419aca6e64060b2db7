•Records 400% growth year-on-year basis Mikano Motors Nigeria has said it is targeting a 200 per cent growth in 2023 despite being the general elections year in Nigeria. This is coming even as Mikano Motors recorded 400 per cent growth on a year-on-year basis, despite the global economic predicament, which has ravaged the world, including Nigeria. General Manager, Mikano Motors, Ralph Haidar, stated this at the New Year and award of staff recognition party at Karameh City, Ogun State. At the ceremony, the company’s outstanding workers received awards ranging from the Most Creative staff of the year to the Most Efficient staff of the year. Haidar commended the company’s workers for what he described as outstanding performance during the year 2022. He said: “We are using this event to recognise our staff, which has shown commitment and dedication in an effort to take the organisation to the next level. “Without our hardworking staff,” he pointed out, “it would have been impossible for the company to attain the kind of growth we experienced last year. “We were the fastest growing automotive company in 2022 and recorded the highest sales in Nigeria after Toyota. We couldn’t have been able to attain such height without our dedicated staff. “I must confess that our staff have performed optimally. So, this award ceremony is about recognising their efforts, demonstration of team spirit and bonding. We are saying we value their contributions to the success of the company in 2022. “This is a new year with renewed energy. We are encouraging our staff to do more. We are expecting more support, commitment and belief in our dream to take the industry beyond and above 2023,” he said. Over 25 staff from different departments of the company received awards and certificates during the event.
