Rounding off off the euphoria-filled Detty December extravaganza, it was a stunning experience watching Nigerian music stars Asake, and Seyi Vibez, alongside Ghanaian prodigy Black Sherif, thrill over 10,000 music and beer lovers at the debut edition of the Beer With Us Festival (BWUFEST) at the Landmark Leisure beach in Oniru, Lagos. Championed by leading showbiz company, Achievas Entertainment Limited, the event was a party mix of beer and music which manifested into a raving party with Afrobeats sounds. Asake, who has been the rave of the moment since early 2022, did not disappoint his fans as he came with his bangers giving an incredible back-to-back performance with hit songs, including Palazzo, Sungba, Mr. Money with the vibe, Terminator, Peace be unto you and Joha, amongst others. Black Sherif also came with his style; the 21-year-old Ghanaian star who gained recognition for ‘First Sermon’ and ‘Second Sermon’ went with the mystical story of “Kwaku the Traveler ”. He got the crowd to scream out their lungs on the refrain, “of course I fucked up, who never fuck up hands in the air,” and performed a host of songs electrifying the ‘Beer With Us’ stage. Maintaining the tempo, Seyi Vibez came in with his Yoruba and street lingua music. Speaking on the success of the show, Daniel Chiori Cole, a lead executive of Achievas entertainment divulge that what a lot of people tagged as a show test run turned out to be massive. He said: “We have always been committed to our watchword which is providing world-class quality entertainment and that we did at the debut edition of BWUFEST. You never can tell what we have up the sleeve for the next edition.”
