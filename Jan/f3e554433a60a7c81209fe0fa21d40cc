Lagos State chapter of All Progressives Congress (APC), yesterday, condemned the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Jide Adediran, for violence allegedly unleashed by his supporters in Surulere area of the state. Reacting to a viral video showing armed supporters in campaign vehicles of the Lagos PDP governorship candidate ‘Jandor’ engaging in gun battle with political opponents in Surulere, the Party’sPublicity Secretary, Seye Oladejo, in a statement, said the attack is a ploy to instil fear in the hearts of voters and cause apathy. “Our attention has been drawn to the terror unleashed on innocent and law abiding citizens of Lagos State by the gubernatorial candidate, Jide Adediran, popularly known as Jandor, in the course of his campaign in Surulere Council. “The incident left in its wake, several people injured and three reportedly died. We condemn in strong terms, the unwarranted and unprovoked resort to violence on the citizens of the state in the name of electioneering campaign. “In broad daylight, Jandor’s thugs fired guns at their hapless victims, who ran for dear lives. Lagos cherishes its enviable status as the safest state in the country  – a result of long running and painstaking investment in security. “We view this attack as a ploy to instil fear in the hearts of would-be voters as we count down to the elections. It’s pathetic to note that a candidate seeking to govern the state could be seen actively promoting violence to disrupt the peace of the citizens. “We call on the law enforcement agencies to thoroughly investigate the incident, bring the culprits to book and beef security across the state to forestall a reoccurrence. We urge Lagosians to remain calm and law abiding as the state government remains irrevocably committed to its onerous duty of ensuring the safety of lives and properties of all and sundry.”
