Beneficiaries of Enugu State Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) have relayed their experiences in the well-thought-out and innovative programmes of the Enugu SMEs Centre under Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi’s administration, describing them as “fulfilling, unique and edifying.” The beneficiaries said: “Those of us who have gone through Enugu SMEs Centre’s programmes are amazed by the creative ingenuity of handlers, as well as the productivity and achievements of the state government through the agency’s interventions.” Listing intervention programmes of the Ugwuanyi administration, through the Enugu SMEs Centre, in impacting the lives of youths as business owners and emerging entrepreneurs in the state, the beneficiaries told Ugwuanyi, who is the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for Enugu North Senatorial District in the forthcoming general elections, that they are behind his senatorial bid, and that of other PDP candidates in the state. This, they said, is in appreciation of his good works in the SMEs sector and beyond. Speaking when a delegation from Enugu North Senatorial District visited the governor at the Government House, Enugu, to express gratitude and present their businesses to the governor as testimonies of his interventions in the SMEs sector, the State Coordinator of Beneficiaries of Enugu SMEs Programmes (BESMEP), Prince-Will Ugwu, stated that the beneficiaries have become core crusaders of the Ugwuanyi’s senatorial agenda due to his impact in their lives.
