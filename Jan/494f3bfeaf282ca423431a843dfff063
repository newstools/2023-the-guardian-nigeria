Coalitions of Civil Society Organisations have tasked political candidates in the 2023 general elections to involve them in the development and implementation of national policies.  This was disclosed, yesterday, at a pre-screening of a documentary, tagged, “Untold Impact, the role of civil society in development,” supported by Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre (CISLAC), Akin Fadeyi Foundation and Ford Foundation.
   
The Convener of ‘Untold Impact,’ Mrs Efua Edeh emphasised the need to address the disconnect between the CSOs and public knowledge of their critical role in Nigeria’s democracy and national development.
   
She said the Untold Impact documentary on the role of CSOs in development, was aimed at showing the impact that CSOs were making in the society. She said:  “Currently, there are various perceptions of the roles of many civil society organisations. With varied perceptions of the CSOs, it creates a vacuum of distrust that will impede holistic contribution in fundraising and volunteer engagement for national development.  According to her, the documentary will further sensitise the public on the importance of the CSOs, which comprise citizen’s freedom of association. She noted that when the government aligned with CSOs, it enhanced development in all sectors. The episodes in the documentary include: the role of CSOs in Education, Health, Nutrition, Youth, Women and Persons with Disabilities.
