 Golden Globes | Image: Britannica Here are the nominees in key categories for the 80th Golden Globe Awards, which will be handed out on Tuesday. “The Banshees of Inisherin” — a dark comedy about the abrupt end of a friendship on a tiny Irish island during the 1920s — leads all films with eight nominations, followed by the surreal sci-fi flick “Everything Everywhere All at Once” with six. Comedian Jerrod Carmichael will host the Globes, which return to television after last year’s industry-wide boycott of the event and kick off an awards season that culminates with the Oscars on March 12. – FILM –
