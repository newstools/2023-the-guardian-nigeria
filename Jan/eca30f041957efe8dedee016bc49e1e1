The Jehovah’s Witnesses, yesterday, resumed their in-person assembly programmes across the globe, after nearly three years of suspension for online assemblies and conventions. The assemblies have been holding virtually since the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Though the witnesses resumed meetings at their Kingdom Halls from April 2022, but their larger assembly facilities across the globe remained under lockdown.          In a statement, yesterday, re  port showed that as at 9:00am, thousands thronged the Assembly Hall in Lekki, Lagos, the first of the assemblies since the start of the pandemic. It was gathered that 62 other assemblies are also holding this weekend in other cities, including Badagry, Ota, Daluwon, Benin, and Awi. The assembly programme, entitled: “Jehovah’s United Family” featured a three-part symposium. The speakers highlighted the Biblical histories of Elihu, a friend to Job, Lydia, a first-century disciple of Jesus, and Jesus himself. These historical figures were excellent examples of helping those around them to feel comfortable, an ideal requirement for peaceful family relations. Over 3,000 participants attended the event, more than the capacity of the Assembly Hall, which was attributed to the excitement of the attendees returning to their in-person assemblies after nearly three years. The 2023 Assembly series of Jehovah’s Witnesses will be held in six continents, over 200 countries and over 400 languages. In Nigeria, The programme will be presented in English, Gun, Pidgin, Yoruba, Igbo and French. More information about the programme may be found on jw.org.
