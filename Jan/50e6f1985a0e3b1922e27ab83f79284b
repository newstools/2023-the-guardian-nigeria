The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) returns to the tube with a newly packaged 30-minute weekly television programme that will regularly x-ray the Nigerian telecommunications and Information Communications Technology (ICT) industry and provide awareness for telecommunication consumers across the country and beyond. The weekly programme, tagged Telecom Weekly, according to  Director, Public Affairs, Reuben Muoka, debut on NTA Network Services comprising more than 45 stations across the 36 states and Abuja, yesterday, Tuesday, January 10, 2023, by 5.00 p.m. The radio version of the programme will also air on Thursdays at 8 p.m. on the Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria (FRCN) Network, for simultaneous transmission to all states of the Federation with all the local FRCN stations expected to hook up during the weekly programme.
  T
he programme is expected to add to the Commissionâ€™s share of voice on radio and television in a bid to provide stakeholders with timely information about developments and issues in the telecommunications industry. Apart from simplifying issues about telecommunications services for the average consumer, one of the cardinal focus of the programme will be to continuously create awareness among various stakeholders about the activities and programmes of the Commission as it seeks to achieve regulatory excellence. User experiences, gathered through consumer-related events and vox pop, will be used to spice the programme to enable the cross-section of consumers of telecommunications services to learn from such experiences and apply them in the usage of their services. Expert opinions will also feature prominently to facilitate the process of creating awareness about the industry. Also, quiz sessions where viewers and listeners will win prizes will be a regular feature of the programme.
