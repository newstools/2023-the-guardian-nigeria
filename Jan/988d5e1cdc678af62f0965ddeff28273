Former Minister of Health, Professor A.B.C. Nwosu has resigned from his membership of the Peoples Democratic Party and its Board of Trustees (BOT). In a letter of resignation addressed to the National Chairman of PDP,  Dr. Iyorchia Ayu dated January 12, 2023, Prof Nwosu said his exit from the party would not take a day longer than the date on the letter. The office of the PDP National Chairman has accordingly acknowledged receipt of his resignation letter. Nwosu, a prominent Igbo leader from Otolo Nnewi in Anambra State, wrote: “This resignation for me is a matter of conscience and principle because of the Party’s inability to adhere to the rotation provision in its (PDP) Constitution. “The journey to rotational presidency between the North and South of Nigeria has been a long  and arduous one and I have been involved.  Nigeria and the Peoples Democratic Party  (PDP) must learn to keep to an agreement reached by a Constituent Assembly (1995); and enshrined in the Party’s (PDP)  Constitution (1998).” Copies of the resignation letter were also sent to the Acting Chairman of the PDP Board of Trustees, Chief Adolphus Wabara and the Chairman PDP Ward I Nnewi, his home town. Professor Nwosu was a founding member of the PDP and had played major roles in the affairs of the party both at the National and Zonal levels.
