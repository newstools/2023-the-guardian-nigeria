 Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) will share experiences and learnings from the last three years fighting gender-based violence and other harmful practices in Africa, at the Spotlight Initiative High-Level Multi-Stakeholder Continental Summit, to be held on February 15-17 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.  The Spotlight Initiative Africa Regional Programme (SIARP) will hold the High-Level Multi-Stakeholder Continental Summit to showcase learnings and promote networking between CSOs with Member States, the African Union Commission (AUC), UN agencies and other relevant actors on ending violence against women and girls in Africa. At the end of the Summit, CSOs will draft key recommendations to the AUC, governments, donors and researchers on ending gender-based violence in Africa. The three-day Summit will bring together participants from across Africa, high level representatives of Member States, Regional Economic Communities (RECs), UN Agencies and Development Partners. The interactive Summit will feature World Cafes, Storytelling and Networking sessions where participants will share stories and insights on experiences and learnings in ending violence, harmful practices and the promotion of sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights in the region. The Summit, organized by the UN Women Liaison Office to the AU and UNECA, in cooperation with the African Union Commission (AUC) Women, Gender and Youth Directorate (WGYD), and with the support of the Spotlight Initiative, is expected to leverage the work of CSOs already involved in the SIARP, building on their experiences and learnings over the last three years. The Summit will take place in the side-lines of the African Union Heads of Assembly Summit in 18-19 February. Distributed by APO Group on behalf of UN Women – Africa.
