• Amotekun must be strengthened, don, retired officer restate
• OPC urges members, Nigerians to vote credible candidates into leadership A former Speaker and current Minority Leader of Oyo State House of Assembly, Asimiju Alarape, has said that the spirit of the late Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi III; people’s support and God will bring victory to the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Oyo Town in the 2023 polls.
Alarape stated this, while speaking with The Guardian in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital.
The lawmaker said though Oba Adeyemi is no more, his spirit would always support the APC, adding that ancestors do not forget their children. Meanwhile, the Orangun of Oke-Ila, Oba Adedokun Abolarin; the former Director of Military Intelligence (DMI) and former Deputy Director-General of the State Security Services, Gen. Kunle Togun (rtd); a Yoruba leader, Otunba Deji Osiboju and other experts in the security sector, yesterday, reiterated the need for state police to tackle security conundrum besetting the country and South-West in particular. This also came as Rear Admiral Leye Jaiyeola (rtd) called for the effective fine-tuning of the law establishing Amotekun Corps, while Dr. Modupe Albert of the Department of Politics and International Relations of Lead City University (LCU), Ibadan, cautioned the rich against making public donations in religious places. They spoke during the Yoruba Leadership and Peace Initiative (TYLPI) workshop on safety and security in Yoruba land, which was held at the Conference Centre, Lead City University, Ibadan, the Oyo State capital. Togun, who is the Chairman of Amotekun Corps, said Nigeria, as a federation, must embrace state policing. However, the Oodua People’s Congress (OPC), New Era, yesterday, urged its members and Nigerians generally to collect their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) to vote in credible candidates in the forthcoming polls. National Publicity Secretary of the organisation, Sina Akinpelu, gave the charge while speaking with The Guardian in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital. Akinpelu said it was only with PVCs that Nigerians could effect the much-needed change in the country. He urged Nigerians not to disenfranchise themselves by refusing to vote in the polls.
