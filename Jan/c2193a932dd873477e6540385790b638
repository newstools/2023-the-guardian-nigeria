Download logo Government notes the extensive damage caused by the ongoing heavy rains across the country, affecting both households and road infrastructure, among other vital infrastructure.  One of the roads that have been hugely affected by these rains is the Mahlangatsha road in the Manzini region. Government has since deployed a team from the Ministry of Public Works and Transport to assess the road, as well as others, with a view of exploring mitigating measures that can be implemented.  We would like to appreciate members of the public that continue to report challenges thatÂ  they face in their respective communities. Government endeavours to do everything possible to ensure that these are attended to, in spite of the scarce resources available, for the benefit of the Nation.
