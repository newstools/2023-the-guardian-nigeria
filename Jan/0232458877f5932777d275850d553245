An underwriting firm, AXA Mansard Health, has said it would continue to deliver quality health insurance to its customers. The operator said it was also committed to the growth of its services across the healthcare value chain in the country. The Chief Executive Officer, Tope Adeniyi, spoke at a stock-taking to round off the year at the weekend. He said quality healthcare insurance would have been a mirage without a burgeoning healthcare provider sector. “Our nation’s healthcare sector has been making steady strides in accessibility, sophistication and availability. While as a nation, we still have a long way to go in ensuring affordability, quality and accessibility are improved, we must commend the efforts of all stakeholders who have brought us this far,” he said. Adeniyi said last year came with a lot of challenges but AXA Mansard and its service providers were able to work together to weather the storm.
