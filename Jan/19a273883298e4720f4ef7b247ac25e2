A 26-year-old man, identified as Precious Adiele,  who is suspected to be a member of Iceland cult group, has died, following a  clash with a rival group believed to be Deygbam. Adiele was killed on Saturday during the clash that ensued at about 7:42 p.m. The Guardian also learnt that an elderly man was killed during the clash at Gambia Street in Mile 2 Diobu, Port Harcourt City Council of Rivers State. A source said suspected Deygbam members, after hacking their first target to death, stormed a building, where another member of the Bar Beach Iceland cult group is believed to be residing, but did not meet him at home. According to the source, the suspected Deygbam cultists, thereafter, set the building ablaze when they (Deygbam cultists) could not find their target. He further revealed that an elderly man who was trapped in the inferno was burnt beyond recognition.
   
The rampaging cultists fled the scene before the arrival of officers from Divisional Police headquarters Mile 1 and other Police formations.
 
Consequently, there was heightened tension yesterday, over fears of reprisals and counter-reprisals between the two rival cult groups.
   
Spokesperson for Rivers Police Command, Superintendent of Police (SP), Grace Iringe-Koko, who confirmed the incident, said the deceased was a member of  Iceland Cult group, and an alleged notorious armed robber, who had been involved in a series of robberies and just returned from a Correctional Centre.
   
Iringe-Koko said the state Commissioner of Police, Okon Effiong, has deployed tactical teams to maintain law and order and arrest other members of the cult group, adding that the investigation is ongoing.
