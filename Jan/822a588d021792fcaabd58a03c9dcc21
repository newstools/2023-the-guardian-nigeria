• Alleges Oyetola planning secret meeting with judges on Friday
• ‘Judges shut doors against contact with petitioners’ The Osun State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has exposed a devilish plan by former governor of the state, Gboyega Oyetola, to influence the judgment of the governorship tribunal in his favour. It, therefore, warned against anti-democratic actions that might threaten the peace of the state. In a statement yesterday, the Osun State Caretaker Chairman of the party, Dr. Adekunle Akindele, alleged that credible information revealed that the former governor was planning to schedule a secret meeting with the members of the tribunal for this Friday at a closely guarded location. The goal of the meeting, according to the statement, is to convince the panel members to sway their ruling in favour of the petitioners. However, the plan is meeting a brick wall as the judges are reported to have shut the doors against any such meeting, being incorruptible officers of law with hard-earned reputation and years of unblemished service. “Information at our disposal confirms the evil plot to corrupt and hijack the tribunal outcome. The plot has reached an advanced stage. The former governor is running around to get the judges to agree to a meeting for this Friday. But he will not succeed because the judges will not agree to such a meeting. Panel members are men of integrity and good conscience. “We want to affirm the trust of PDP and Governor Ademola Adeleke in the integrity and incorruptibility of members of the panel and the Nigerian judiciary as a whole. We know the panel members, their antecedents and high sense of equity and fairness. We have no doubt the panel will not succumb to the evil scheming of those who detest democracy and are desperate to upturn the will of the people,” the statement affirmed.
