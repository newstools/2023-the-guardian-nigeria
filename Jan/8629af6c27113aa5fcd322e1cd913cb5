Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), Niger/Kogi command, has handed over to the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), Niger State, 317 compressed packages of substances suspected to be cannabis sativa weighing 253.6kg, estimated at N2.605 million, intercepted along Abuja-Lokoja highway by the patrol teams of the command. Briefing the journalists shortly before handing over the substances to the NDLEA Commander, Haruna Kweteshe, at the NCS Headquarters in Minna, the NCS Controller, Busayo Kadejo, explained that the seizure was made possible due to diligence by officers and men of the command. He noted that if the packages had escaped the patrol teams, it would have helped in the sustenance of crimes such as kidnapping, banditry, thuggery and other social vices. “I strongly feel it is important that as the general elections draw closer, all and sundry should be on alert and report any suspicious activity to law enforcement agencies,” Kadejo said. He further stated that before handing over the seizures to NDLEA, the command obtained necessary approval from the Comptroller General of Customs, Col. Hameed Ali (rtd), for further agency action in view of the synergy between Customs and NDLEA. Responding, Kweteshe reiterated that “there is no hiding place for those involved in illicit drug business” in the state, as NDLEA was poised to track them anywhere they reside and deal with accordingly, when caught. He appreciated the Customs for the synergy between the two agencies and urged it to maintain the tempo. “This drug will not go to the market again. From our custody, it will be destroyed completely,” he assured and called on Nigerians to provide useful information that would assist the agency track down drug peddlers across the state. The Guardian gathered that no arrest was made during the seizure.
