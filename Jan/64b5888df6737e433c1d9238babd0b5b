Government Secondary School (GSS), Karu, has won this year’s Power Forward Basketball Championship, which held in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). The ninth in the series of the United States’ (U.S) National Basketball Association (NBA) sponsored youth development programme, tagged Power Forward, the championship was organised in conjunction with PanAfricare and ExxonMobil for secondary school students in Abuja. As part of the event, former NBA player, Cedric Ceballo, held a clinic for young players, followed by a community outreach leading to the boys and girls’ final matches at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium, Abuja. Students from 40 secondary schools, made up 42 teams (30 boys teams and 12 girls teams) played 105 games, with Government Secondary School, Karu, defeating Government Secondary School, Garki and Raberto Schools, Wuse II, to win the boys and girls’ categories respectively. Speaking at the event, NBA Africa Vice President, Gbemisola Abudu, who is also Country Head, Nigeria, said, “we are using this programme for the talent identification and part of what we are doing is creating a very well defined pathway from young age all the way to the elite level. “We are also providing opportunity for anyone, who is identified to have the talent to play basketball and to follow up. “From an educational perspective. I would say one of the amazing things PanAfricare has done is to create an alumni programme for all the participants of the programme. We have an amazing tracking record of all the participants.” ExxonMobil Business and Government Relations Manager, Adedoyin Adelabu, said the programme would motivate some of the students into becoming big players for Nigeria. PanAfricare Country Director for Nigeria, Dr. Patrick Adah, expressed optimism that ‘Power Forward’ programme will continue to succeed.
