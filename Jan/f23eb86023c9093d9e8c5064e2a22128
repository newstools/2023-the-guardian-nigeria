The largest fintech company in Africa, Flutterwave, has announced its plan to revamp its retail product Barter. This product provides customers with money transfer and virtual card services. On January 31, 2023, Flutterwave informed customers via email of its decision to rebuild the platform to improve efficiency and effectiveness. The company said it intends to provide a better customer experience with its product team working on a new version. The new platform aims to address customer issues by targeting specific problems through the decoupling of existing services. While some features of the platform, such as new user sign-up and barter-to-barter transfers, will be temporarily unavailable during maintenance, customers will still have access to their funds and the ability to pay bills and airtime. The company suggested using Send by Flutterwave for cross-border fund transfers.
