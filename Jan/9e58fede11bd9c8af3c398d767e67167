The governorship candidate of the Labour Party (LP) in Lagos State, Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour, yesterday, lamented that many of the party’s members were being attacked on a daily basis. He, therefore, urged the Inspector-General of Police (IGP) to look into the matter and ensure that the culprits are brought to book to serve as deterrent to others.
  
Rhodes-Vivour, who spoke at a briefing in Lagos to address issues bothering on collection of Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs), was reacting to the video of a man attacked at Ojo Local Council Development Area (LCDA) for allegedly pasting posters of the party.
 
He said: “Two days ago, we had a young man in Ojo that was pasting our party’s posters attacked. We can identify the people behind them and we are also going to pursue this to the full extent of the law.
“We must say that for a state that has been ruled by one party for over 20 years, if they have done so well for the people, why are they so intimidated? Why are they terrorising people from carrying on with their freewill to decide who gets elected? If the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) at the national level behaved this same way, they would never have become a ruling party.”
“We cannot allow this to continue; we must push back. This is not the first time this has happened. Recently in Ikorodu, our women leader was harassed. We will not be bullied or intimidated. There is a need for the law enforcement to sit up and do the needful.” The state Chairman of the party, Mrs. Dayo Ekong, said the mission of the party was to rescue Nigeria from hopelessness and hardship. Also, the Secretary of the party, Sam Okpala, expressed optimism that the LP would get 95 per cent votes in Lagos during the general elections in a free and fair contest.
