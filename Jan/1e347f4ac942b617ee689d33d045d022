Atiku Campaign Organisation has asked Nigerians to be wary of alleged antics of All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, and not to submit to his lordship as he currently enjoys in Lagos. Spokesman for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Presidential Campaign Council, Charles Aniagwu, gave the advice at a news conference, yesterday, in Asaba. He warned that Nigerians would be subjecting themselves to internal slavery if they allowed Tinubu to become president. He said Tinubu, who allegedly captured Lagos, was looking for an avenue to extend his control to other 35 states and Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and urged Nigerians to avoid repeating the mistake Lagosians allegedly made by allowing him to control everything that happened in the entire state.	He said: “For those of you, who may not know, a number of major projects and programmes in Lagos are controlled by this same individual. “When you get to Lagos and ask them about BRT, you will discover that this man’s family handles it. His son handles the signage in Lagos, which is a very big business; a company that is said to belong to this same man handles the collection of taxes in Lagos. “You also know how he handpicks those who will govern Lagos to the extent that Ambode, a man that was doing well was taken out because he disagreed with them on how to share the funds of the people of Lagos.” He said for such a person to aspire to govern our country, it will be very detrimental to all of us. “If we don’t want to submit ourselves to slavery, Nigerians must stop Tinubu from crossing Lagos into the other 35 states and the FCT because that will amount to internal slavery for all of us where he alone will determine the next President, and who gets what and not forces of democratic governance.”
