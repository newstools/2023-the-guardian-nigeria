The Police in Ebonyi State said hoodlums have shot and killed Ebubeagu commander’s wife in Afikpo South Council of the state. The Command Spokesperson, SP Chris Anyanwu, told reporters, in Abakaliki, that the hoodlums also set the commander’s house ablaze. Anyanwu said: “Divisional Police Officer, Afikpo South Division, CSP Ayodele Umujose, has notified us that the Ama-Etiti Amaoso Edda Youth Leader, Nnachi Mba, reported that at about 02:30 a.m., yesterday, the house of the Afikpo South Ebubeagu Commander, Oyeku Chima, located at Owutu Edda, was attacked. “His house was set ablaze, while his wife was killed by the attackers.” “It has not been established who perpetrated the dastardly act. The said Ebubeagu commander alleged that it was one Okporie Ashango and his cohorts. “The Commissioner of Police in the state, CP Aliyu Garba, has directed that immediate investigation be activated by the Deputy Commissioner of Police in-charge of the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (SCIID) to fish out those behind the attack. “Detectives of SCIID and operatives of the Command’s tactical teams have taken over proceedings in the area. “It is rather unfortunate that mischief-makers are still fomenting fracas in the state in spite of the grace of witnessing a new year.”
