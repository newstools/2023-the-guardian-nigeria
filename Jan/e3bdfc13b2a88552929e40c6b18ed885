Embattled Sen. Ishaku Abbo (Adamawa North) has urged his supporters not to lose sleep over the court ruling that removed him as the candidate of All Progressives Congress (APC), since he will appeal the court judgment. Justice Danladi Mohammed of Adamawa High Court 3 had, on Tuesday, ruled that Abbo “cannot contest again” on the APC platform. The judge pointed out that the senator had been expelled from APC by the local council executive. Responding, yesterday, in Yola, Abbo described the judgment as cash-and-carry. His words: “The court is said to be the last hope of the common man, and where it becomes cash-and-carry, it cannot be described as (last hope). It is a bought-over judgment because those who purportedly expelled me from the party are not local council party executives and, therefore, have no jurisdiction to expel me. “It is only the ward executive of the party, according to the APC constitution, that has the right to punish any errant member of the party and not the local council nor even the state exco.” He added that the presiding Judge had once issued a restraining order on the local council officials from parading themselves as exco.
