The Ngwa Development Initiative (NDI) has called for clarification regarding the whereabouts of Abia State Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate, Prof. Uche Ikonne, who, it said, has not appeared in public in more than 50 days despite ongoing campaigns in the state. The group’s President, Daniel Nkasiobi, in a statement issued in Umuahia, the state capital, noted that Ikonne was last seen in public on November 24, last year, during the PDP campaign flag-off, held at Umuahia Township Stadium, where Ikonne, allegedly collapsed due to health challenges. The statement reads: “Nobody, not even the PDP and his godfather, Governor Okezie Ikpeazu, has come out to say anything about his whereabouts. If Ikonne is sick and incapacitated, why are Abia oligarchs hiding his true health status? Why are they playing games with more than three million Abians? What are their plans? What are they hiding? “Is it that there are no men in Isiala Ngwa land or the entire Ukwa-La-Ngwa to question this seeming game being played by Abia PDP? Why are we keeping quiet and watching a few play with our intelligence?” The group, while praying for Ikonne’s quick recovery, stated that there is nothing wrong with anybody falling ill. It said: “We sincerely pray for Ikonne’s quick recovery, but must ask questions about what is going on. “Where is Ikonne? Christmas has gone, and we did not hear a word from him. Not even a New Year message. The elections are in less than two months. What is actually happening? Is Ikonne’s wife part of this conspiracy? Who are those benefitting from this intentional act of keeping Abians in the dark?” The group called on all Ngwa sons, daughters, as well as Abians to step in and resolve this logjam. “We do not want the oligarchy to mess our professor up,” the group added.
