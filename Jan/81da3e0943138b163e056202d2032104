The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has berated the leading presidential candidates over their plan to remove subsidy on the premium motor spirit (PMS) when they are elected. In its New Year message, NLC President, Ayuba Wabba, stated that pronouncements made so far by those seeking election for the office of the President have failed to address fundamental issues underpinning the downstream sector.
 
His words: “Pronouncements by some leading presidential candidates to remove petrol subsidy if elected to office do not address recovery of local refining, affordable refined products, decent jobs, economic expansion, wealth generation, and shared prosperity. The penchant to mouth subsidy removal as a solution to government’s criminal neglect of our public refineries is not only wicked,but also betrays a predilection to lazy quick fixes, surrendering our economy to foreign interests, transfer of government inefficiency on Nigerians, and enslaving our people with poverty and hardship.”  Many of the states that were forced to commence the payment of the national minimum wage still owe workers arrears of unpaid national minimum wage and consequential salary adjustments. Slave labour does not describe this evil enough,” it said.
