Former Governor of Cross River State, Liyel Imoke, and other chieftains of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state have called on Nigerians to shun the All Progressives Congress (APC) for allegedly failing the people. Sensitising the people at different town hall meetings at the weekend in Calabar Municipality, Biase, Akamkpa councils in the state on the need to support the Atiku/Okowa ticket and the PDP towards correcting “the eight disastrous years of APC that has left the citizenry impoverished and despondent, Imoke said: “It will be dangerous and disastrous to entrust APC with power again at the federal and state levels because they have failed woefully.” Imoke, who is the leader of the party in the state and Deputy Director General, Operations of Atiku Abubakar/Ifeanyi Okowa Presidential Campaign Council, cautioned the people against ethnic sentiments in casting their votes, declaring: “Votes wasted on Labour Party (LP) and other mushroom parties would amount to conferring advantage on the rudderless APC and reinforcing failure.” The Senator, representing Cross River South in the National Assembly, Gershom Bassey, recalled the National Bureau of Statistics release, which disclosed that 133 million Nigerians are multi-dimensionally poor, while 63 per cent are poor due to lack of access to healthcare, education, good living standards, employment and security. He said voting for PDP would right those wrongs. He assured the people that Atiku has come up with a blueprint and five-point agenda that would restore Nigeria by upholding equity, social justice, cooperation and establishing strong and effective government that would guarantee safety and security of life and property, among others. The PDP National Women Leader, Prof. Stella Effa-Attoe, pleaded with the people to vote only PDP.
