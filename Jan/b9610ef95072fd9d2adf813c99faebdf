The Imo State Police Command has dismissed the story alleging that Affor-Atta Divisional Police headquarters, in Njaba Council, was set ablaze by hoodlums, on Monday. A statement issued, yesterday, by the Command’s Public Relations Officer, Michael Abattam, described the report as “malicious, misleading and offensive.” The statement reads: “The Command wishes to state that the news is fake, as there was no such attack on any of its divisions or formations on the alleged date in the state. The Command views the news as malicious, misleading, offensive and a calculated attempt to cause disaffection in the minds of Imo people, and to tarnish the confidence and trust the Command has built over the years. “First, for purposes of clarity, there is no Afor-Atta Divisional Police Headquarters in Njaba. And the alleged burnt police station was formerly an out-post under the Divisional Headquarters located at Njaba, after it was attacked sometime in 2021 by hoodlums, led by one Ejima, presently in custody. The few personnel were relocated to the Divisional Headquarters, and, since then, the out-post has been out of use.” The state Commissioner of Police, Mohammed Barde, expressed gratitude to the people of the state, urging that the story be disregarded.
