Advising beneficiaries, the state Commissioner for Women, Children Affairs, Empowerment and Social Development, who also doubles as chairman of the  disbursement committee, Mrs Faith Opene, hinted that in compliance with the extant fiscal policies of the Central bank of Nigeria, the N200,000 grants would be transferred into beneficiaries bank accounts.

The committee chairman averred that from the inception of the empowerment programme, the state government has been releasing N50m monthly, saying that no person would benefit twice from it, as according to her, it is difficult to manuevre the system.
