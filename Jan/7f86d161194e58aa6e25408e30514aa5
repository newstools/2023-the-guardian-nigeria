The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) on Tuesday said it has reviewed downwards the registration fees clubs would have to pay to take part in the 2023 Federation Cup competition. NFF’s Acting Director of Competitions, Ruth David, disclosed that the male clubs would pay N70,000 to be part of the competition, while the female clubs would pay N50,000 only. “The Federation opted to review the fees downwards in order to encourage many more clubs to participate in this year’s competition in both the men’s and women’s categories,” she said. David however said the competition’s 2023 programme itself was unchanged from what was officially communicated to the Football Associations (FAs) in the 36 states and the FCT. “Registration of clubs will hold over a fortnight from Monday to Jan. 30, while submission of completed players’ forms for the production of licences will be from Jan. 31 to Feb. 6,” she said. The NFF official added that this year’s Federation Cup competition in the various states and the FCT would take place between Feb. 18 and March 19. “The FAs in the states and the FCT are expected to submit the names of their two representatives for the national competition to the NFF by March 20,” she said. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that dates for the competition’s playoff matches, the National Draws and the different stages of the national competition, would be determined soon.
