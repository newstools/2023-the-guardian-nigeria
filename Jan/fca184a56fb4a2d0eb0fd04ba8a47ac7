• Ohanaeze hails governor over state’s new status Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State has disclosed that his biggest joy is that recent actualisation of his administration’s struggle for the state to join the league of oil producing states will ensure fulfillment of his prayer that his preferred successor, Dr. Peter Mbah, who is the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), will perform better than him if elected. Ugwuanyi said that  Enugu’s oil producing status is one of the successes of his administration, which will bring immense fortunes to the socio-economic development of the state, stressing: “I’ m glad that Mbah will have huge resources to perform better than me if elected.” Meanwhile, the youth wing of the apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council (OYC), yesterday, hailed Ugwuanyi for the enlistment of Enugu as an oil producing state. The group noted that the development followed the outcome of a meeting, late last year, by the Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC), in Abuja, ratifying the request of the Ugwuanyi administration for the state to be enlisted as an oil producing state. In a statement, the National President of OYC, Okwu Nnabuike, said the development was the result of Ugwuanyi’s doggedness. Okwu noted that the governor told a delegation of the University of Nigeria Alumni Association (UNAA), Nsukka Branch, during a solidarity visit at the Government House, saying: “As I am leaving office, I am happy that the money that will be coming to Enugu won’t be what I witnessed. It won’t be what we suffered.” Reacting, Okwu said Igbo youths are delighted that “ Ugwuanyi relentlessly pursued this goal until it was achieved. “What this means to the economy and development of Enugu is monumental. It is victory for the entire people of the state, including those yet unborn.”
