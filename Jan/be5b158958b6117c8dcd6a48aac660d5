The Social Democratic Party (SDP) has denied that it was in alliance talks with the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu for the 2023 general elections. The party insisted that its presidential candidate, Prince Adebayo Adebayo, is all out to win the forthcoming election and won’t step down for any candidate. National Publicity Secretary of the SDP, Rufus Aiyenigba, stated this at a press conference in Abuja on Thursday. He was reacting to a statement credited to a former member of the party, Alfa Mohammad who had claimed that the SDP would adopt the APC candidate for next’ year poll. Mohammad also claimed that the SDP had done its assessment and discovered that the presidential flag-bearer of the ruling party is the best. But Aiyenigba while addressing journalists, described Mohammed as a compulsive impostor and fabricator of falsehood who had been expelled from the SDP. He described Mohammed as a member of the APC and a strong member of a political group committed to the actualization of Bola Tinubu’s presidential ambition, South West Agenda for Asiwaju (SWAGA). Aiyenigba said: “The attention of the leadership of the SDP has been called to some dishonest and illegitimate publications by one Alfa Mohammed who had claimed he was speaking on behalf of our great Party, and purportedly with respect to the Party’s Presidential Candidate and collaboration with other political parties. But SDP disowns. Mohammed and insists that “He is on his own” “As a matter of fact, Alfa Mohammed is a complete persona non-grata in the Social Democratic Party. He is a compulsive impostor and fabricator of falsehood. “The Party had in the past put a disclaimer on this same man, a former member of the party when it was first discovered that he was fond of concocting spurious, sometimes fraudulent, and unfounded reports and stories.”
