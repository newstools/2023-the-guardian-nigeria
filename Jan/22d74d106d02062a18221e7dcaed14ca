Super Eagles Midfielder, Alex Iwobi, is expected to be out of action for three weeks after he damaged his ligaments in Friday’s Everton FC loss to Manchester United. The encounter was the FA Cup third round tie at the Old Trafford, where Everton lost 1-3 to Manchester United. England international, Marcus Rahford, scored his fifth goal in as many games after creating two others to help his club into the fourth round of the FA Cup. The Nigerian international, who had been in a sparkling form for his club, left the field on a stretcher during the second half after a tackle by United’s Tyrell Malacia. The injury is a further blow to Everton, who dropped into the Premier League relegation zone after a heavy home defeat by Brighton last week. Defender, Conor Coady conceded they are in “a bad place,” but they have showed they are fighting for under-pressure manager, Coach Frank Lampard.
