We are truly thankful for their partnership.” Commissioner for Crisis Management Janez Lenarčič said “The global food insecurity is our utmost concern, including in Eastern and Southern Africa . Just now, famine is already knocking on the door in Somalia. The newly-allocated funds will help those in a dire situation meet their emergency food needs. We remain committed to supporting our humanitarian partners, like the WFP, in providing assistance to those who need it the most.” Much of the funding will go towards meeting the basic food and nutrition needs of millions of people across eastern and southern Africa. This includes, among other emergencies, the millions of people in need of assistance in Sudan, those affected by conflict in northern Mozambique, and Burundian and Congolese refugees in Tanzania. Targeting eleven countries, the contribution allows WFP to provide life-saving assistance at a time when humanitarian needs continue to soar.
