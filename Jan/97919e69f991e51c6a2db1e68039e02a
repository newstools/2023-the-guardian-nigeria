The year 2023 has a busy sports calendar for Zenith Bank, which is one of the country’s biggest supporters of the sector. In the bank’s plate are National Women Basketball League, Delta Principals Cup and Delta Headmasters Cup. The bank, at some point, sponsored the U-13, U-15 Future Eagles competition and the official bank of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), footing the bill of Super Eagles’ foreign manager for about five years. And now, the bank’s Group Managing Director, Ebenezer Onyeagwu, has reassured that all the major events in the outfit’s sports calendar would be staged in the New Year. Onyeagwu said it was always a pleasure for the organisation to stage sporting events in its calendar in support of Nigerian youths and sports in general. He added: “We have budget for all our sporting events every year. COVID-19 was a threat two years ago but the past few months have been cases of natural causes (flooding) and federation crisis affecting our events. “On our part, the commitment remains the same and we are always happy and ready to support sports. This year 2023, we can confirm that our major events – Women Basketball, Delta Principals’ and Headmasters’ Cup – are coming up. We almost staged basketball last year, but time was so short after all was agreed.” He also assured that the bank would still sponsor the social club events at Ikoyi Club and Lagos Country Club this year.
