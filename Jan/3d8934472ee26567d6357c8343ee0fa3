The Federal Government is constructing no fewer than 83 internal road projects across the nation’s tertiary educational institutions. Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, stated this yesterday while handing over 1.8km internal roads at the Federal University, Birnin Kebbi, Kebbi State. Fashola said the ministry had intervened and handed over 64 road projects in various tertiary federal institutions as at March 2022, 18 projects ready to be handed over, while attending to 19 roads in similar institutions across the country. According to him, this is consistent with their progressive ideal of improving the human condition as well as critical intervention to support education. His words: “The gap of our infrastructure needs is steadily being bridged by a gradual process of repairs, renewal and construction on major highways and it has reached the schools. “During the construction, about 33 skilled and unskilled labourers were employed in the process, contributing to the job creation initiative of the Federal Government.” Represented by the Federal Controller of Works, Kebbi State office, James Bugu, the minister hopes that the school will ensure the asset is used properly and not abused. The Vice Chancellor, Federal University Birnin Kebbi, Prof. Muhammad Zaiyan-Umar, thanked the Federal Government for its support to the university with series of interventions through Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs), National Universities Commission (NUC) and Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund). Zaiyan-Umar also thanked President Muhammadu Buhari for timely release of funds for all project interventions to the university.  He pointed out that the road would beautify the environment, ease movement to the new senate building, faculties, sports complex and student hostels among others.
