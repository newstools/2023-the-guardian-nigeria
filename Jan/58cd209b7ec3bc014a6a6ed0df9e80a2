THE Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) has disclosed that 324 persons died and 1,706 others injured in road crashes in Kogi State last year. In a chat with newsmen, yesterday, in Lokoja, Kogi FRSC Sector Commander, Stephen Dawulung, described the 2022 crashes as unfortunate and saddening. He disclosed that from January to December 2022, the corps recorded 458 road crashes in Kogi involving 5,161 persons, in which 324 died and 1,706 injured. “To us as a corps, the casualty and the rate of crashes within that year is very high and unacceptable, but that’s the reality facing us today. We are not happy with the outcome of the report, looking at the enormity of sensitisation and enlightenment campaigns we carried out during the period under review. “Of course, we have to blame this on the recklessness of the motorists, some of who continually refused to heed traffic rules and regulations to safety,” he said. The sector commander called on motorists to always ensure their vehicles are road-worthy before embarking on a journey and to drive with care on the highways. He said: “This 2023, my command will continue enforcement and enlightenment programmes against speed, overloading and mixed loading of goods and passengers, especially in trucks and other vehicles meant to convey only goods.” Dawulung also advised motorists to exhibit high level of discipline and adhere strictly to road traffic regulations to avoid such ugly incidents.
