Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State’s quest to represent Enugu North Senatorial District in the National Assembly on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) continued to gather momentum as council areas and communities in the district gave their endorsement and pledged to deliver the governor in the forthcoming general elections. They also endorsed other candidates of the PDP in the state, including the party’s governorship candidate, Dr. Peter Mbah, and his running mate, Ifeanyi Ossai. The people gave the endorsement when Ugwuanyi visited their areas to interact with them, and seek their blessings ahead of the flag off of the PDP campaign in the state, billed to hold on January 27, 2023, at Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium, Ogui Road, Enugu. The governor’s first port of call was his council, Udenu, where he was given a rousing reception. Addressing his kinsmen and constituents, Ugwuanyi thanked them for the support they have been giving him over the years, stating that he has not taken it for granted.
