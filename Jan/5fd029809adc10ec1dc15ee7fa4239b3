As part of its commitment to national development, the Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG) has said it will hold a series of dialogue on the Nigerian economy with 2023 presidential candidates. According to a statement by Mr. Laoye Jaiyeola, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of NESG, the dialogue is also part of the group’s principle to provide economic foundation for democracy. Jaiyeola said the idea is to accentuate discussions on the roadmap towards an inclusive and prosperous Nigeria. “Nigeria is at a decisive point in its history, and as we countdown to the 2023 polls, it is critical, like never before, to nudge Nigerians towards making informed voting choices. “The challenge before us, therefore, is to ensure the evolution of a process towards a leadership with a broad knowledge of the issues and the political will to steer the ship of our great nation towards shared economic prosperity. “In a bid to live up to our mandate to foster the establishment of an economic foundation for democracy, we will actively seek independent direct engagements with the presidential candidates. “The engagement will dwell on critical economic policy reform issues and prescriptions, in the national interest,” he said. The CEO said the presidential dialogue series is geared towards sensitising stakeholders and citizens on peaceful, informed and accountable democratic participation. He said it would provide a unique platform and opportunity for presidential candidates to discuss their economic agenda in an environment of civil discourse. “The Presidential Dialogue on Economic Policy will seek to curate content that focuses on the state of the economy and addresses the concerns of citizens before the 2023 presidential elections,” he added.
