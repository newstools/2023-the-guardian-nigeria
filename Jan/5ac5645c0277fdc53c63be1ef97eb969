Lagos State Commissioner for Health, Prof. Akin Abayomi; his counterpart in Ekiti, Dr. Oyebanji Filani and the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Nigeria Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), Dr. Faisal Shuaib are among technocrats that will address an international retreat of Society for Family Health (SFH), which starts today in Lagos. President of SFH Board, Prof. Ekanem Braide, stated, yesterday, that the retreat marks the end of the operation of SFH strategic plan, Facilitating People-Centred Healthcare (FPCH), and heralds the development of a new strategy for the next generation, which will be the basis of the operations of the organisation. He added that the retreat also provided “opportunity to pause, reflect, unlearn, learn and re-ignite our collective purpose to finish the job we have started.” SFH prides itself for contributing substantially to Nigeria’s health sector achievement in the last 40 years, including the reduction of maternal mortality from 1,000 per 100,000 live births in 1985 to 512 per 100,000 in 2021, and infant mortality rate from 132 per 1,000 in 1985 to 54 per 1,000 in 2022.
