Floyd Mayweather has revealed plans for an exhibition bout in the United Kingdom (UK) next month. Mayweather retired from professional boxing in 2017, but has since taken part in exhibition fights in places such as, Japan, Abu Dhabi and Dubai. The 45-year-old has never fought in the UK, but that should change within the coming weeks. “A bout is planned in the UK for 2023,” Mayweather told the Sunday Telegraph. “In February, we’re looking forward to coming here and putting on an exhibition for the fans in the UK, because I’ve never had a chance to come over here and fight when I was actively boxing as a professional. “So, hopefully, in February I’ll come over and do an exhibition if it’s possible.” Manny Pacquiao, Mayweather’s long-time rival, also announced on Saturday he would be taking part in exhibitions in Japan in 2023. “I have agreed with Rizin [promotional company] to fight next year,” Pacquiao said during an in-ring presentation. “The date will soon be announced and also my opponent that Rizin will choose. I’m open to and excited to fight a Japanese fighter.”
