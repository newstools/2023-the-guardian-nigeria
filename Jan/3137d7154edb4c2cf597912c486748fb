Going by his experience in military and civilian rules, President Muhammadu Buhari has declared that multi-party democracy is the best system. The President spoke, yesterday, at State House, Abuja, while playing host to a delegation of Universal Peace Federation. He wondered why some African countries were still grappling with unconstitutional change of government, saying: “I thought we had finally put that behind us.” On the Peace Summit being planned for Abuja to bring all African countries together before the end of this administration, Buhari pledged Nigeria’s support, resources, to help in stabilising neighbouring countries. The President described the interest of Universal Peace Federation Africa in the continent as “quite genuine,” saying he was very pleased at the development. Chairperson of the Federation in Africa, Dr. Katherine Rigney, Chairman, Universal Peace Federation International, and Dr. Thomas Walsh, said they believed the forthcoming summit in Nigeria “will top them all,” having held similar meetings in Niger Republic, Senegal, Sao Tome and Principe, South Africa, among others. “During the Abuja Summit, Buhari will be given the Leadership and Good Governance Award, as appreciation of the fantastic results you’ve brought to Nigeria, and a celebration of your anti-corruption credentials,” they disclosed.
