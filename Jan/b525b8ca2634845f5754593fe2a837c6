The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, have been identified as the best options to rescue the country from the myriad of challenges confronting It. [{ad] In a statement yesterday, the lead Spokesperson of the National Youth Campaign Council of the PDP New Generation, Dare Akinniyi, expressed optimism that the PDP would win the election judging by the poor performance of the ruling All-Progressives Congress (APC). He also hinged his optimism on the preparedness of Atiku for the job ahead, going by his well laid-out plans to rescue Nigeria from its challenges. “Atiku Abubakar is the most prepared and most experienced of all the candidates jostling for the position of Nigeria’s next president. He has demonstrated capacity, preparedness and will hit the ground running from day one. “His well-articulated plans on how to rescue the economy, face security challenges and unify the country are a joy to read. He knows what to do, what it takes and how to do it. “We can’t afford to throw a golden opportunity to recover Nigeria away. Atiku Abubakar is the best candidate on the ballot,” he said.
