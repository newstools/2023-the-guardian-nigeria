The Oyo State Coordinator of Atiku Abubakar Presidential Campaign Organisation, Hazeem Gbolarumi, yesterday, said the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, would win at least 70 per cent of total votes cast in Oyo State in next month’s polls. Besides, he said that Atiku would win 40 per cent of votes cast in the South-West region of the country. Gbolarumi, a former deputy governor of the state, stated this in a chat with The Guardian in Ibadan. He said: “You can see that our rally last week for Atiku at the Mapo Hall was impressive. “Go and write it down, Atiku will not take less than 40 per cent of votes in all the Yoruba-speaking states. And he needs only 25 per cent anyway. In Oyo State, particularly, I am assuring you that he will not take anything less than 70 per cent of the total vote cast. Atiku is winning. ”The preponderance of opinion in the state favours Atiku. If you sample people’s opinion, you will be convinced that the electorate in Oyo State are waiting for Atiku. They are set to vote for the former vice president.” ‘’The people of this state will never vote for the All Progressives Congress (APC) with the level of poverty in the country. I don’t know anyone as a major candidate. The only candidate I know is Atiku and is coasting home to victory. ‘’We will all be alive to witness this. Atiku is winning.” Gbolarumi, while speaking on some aggrieved governors that have shown coldness to Atiku’s campaign, said: “One million G-5 cannot stop Atiku from winning the election. Tell them to retrace their steps, Atiku is winning with or without G-5.” He, therefore, urged residents of the state to go out and vote massively for Atiku.
