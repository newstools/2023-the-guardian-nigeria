Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) has donated relief items to 2022 flood victims in Cross River State. The Chief Executive Officer of NUPRC, Gbenga Komolafe, said, yesterday, the commission was touched by challenges faced by the flood victims and decided to provide succur for them as part of the Commission’s corporate social responsibility. Komolafe, who was represented by the Commission’s Technical Assistant, Public Affairs, Mr. Tony Ukpo, explained that to achieve the feat, NUPRC set up a committee saddled with the responsibility of selecting four vulnerable states out of the 22 states affected by the flood to benefit from the initiative. “We decided to put a smile on the faces of the flood victims in four states, Cross River, Imo, Akwa Ibom and Bayelsa. We came here today to show we love you and are ready to support you in this difficult time,” he said. The state Deputy Governor, Prof. Ivara Esu, commended NUPRC and urged the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) to be more proactive in its responsibility to the victims of flood. “You can imagine that the flood we are talking about happened in 2022 but relief materials are just coming, NEMA needs to be more proactive.”
