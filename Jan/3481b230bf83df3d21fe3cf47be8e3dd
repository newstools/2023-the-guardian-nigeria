On market outlook for the week, analysts at United Capital Plc said: “At current levels, we caution investors that the equities market is due a breather and thus we anticipate some of the profit taking that started last week will continue into this week’s sessions. “Nevertheless, we view this as an opportunity to buy attractive stocks on dips as we retain the view that depressed interest rate levels will sustain the fuel for an equity market uptrend in Q1, 2023.” Vetiva Dealing and Brokerage said, “We are likely to see the bears dominate tomorrow’s session, with sectoral indices closing mixed. Also, we expect activity level to remain subdued barring large cross trades in any of the high cap names.” Investor sentiment, as measured by market breadth, closed positive with 18 stocks gained, while 13 declined.
