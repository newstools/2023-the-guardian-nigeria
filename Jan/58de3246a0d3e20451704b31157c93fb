However, excessive drinking can lead to a wide range of negative health and social consequences. Here are 15 tips to help you avoid excessive intoxication when drinking: Set a limit for yourself before you start drinking. Sip your drink slowly, rather than gulping it down. Alternate between alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. Drink water or other non-alcoholic beverages between drinks. Eat a meal before or while you’re drinking. Avoid drinking games or other activities that encourage rapid drinking. Be aware of your level of intoxication and stop drinking when you start to feel drunk. Never drink and drive or operate heavy machinery. Be aware of your surroundings and the people you’re with. Don’t pressure others to drink or to drink more than they’re comfortable with. Avoid drinking if you’re taking medications that interact negatively with alcohol. Never leave your drink unattended. Don’t accept drinks from strangers or open containers. Avoid drinking if you’re feeling upset or emotionally vulnerable. Have a plan to get home safely, whether it’s a designated driver, public transportation, or a taxi.
