A Pension Fund Administrator (PFA), Premium Pension Limited, has strengthened its financial position in the pension industry, as its Assets Under Management (AUM) increased by over N1 trillion. The firm’s Head, Corporate Communications, Aliyu Mohammed Ali, disclosed this at the weekend. He said the firm is among three PFAs out of a total number of 19 that are in the trillion-AUM category. According to him, Premium Pension is the first indigenous-owned PFA to attain over N1 trillion AUM without any form of business combination. He stressed that the firm prides itself as a pacesetter on several performance metrics. One such is the attainment of Information Security Management (ISMS) certification ISO 27001 under the auspices of the British Standard Institute (BSI) in 2015 and a second certification from the BSI in Quality Management System (QMS), ISO 9001 in 2018. “With over 775,000 members and over N323 billion benefits payout to over 88,000 beneficiaries since inception, Premium Pension is among the top three operators,” he said.
