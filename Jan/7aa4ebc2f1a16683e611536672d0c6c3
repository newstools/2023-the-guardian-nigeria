National Pension Commission (PenCom), yesterday, said the Federal Government had released N13.89 billion for payment of Accrued Pension Rights (APRs) of 2022 retirees of Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs). The Commission, in a statement on its official twitter handle, yesterday obtained by the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), noted that APRs represent an employeeâ€™s benefits from June 2004 when the Compulsory Pension Scheme (CPS) came into effect. It added that the beneficiaries were retirees under the Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS). The Commission lauded President Muhammadu Buhari for his support and commitment to implementation of the CPS that revolves around welfare of retirees.
