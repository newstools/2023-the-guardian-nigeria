Same-faith ticket no issue, says group Conference of Autochthonous Ethnic Communities Development Association (CONECDA) has presented a charter of demands to the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, if he is elected into office. This was as the Chairman of Justice and Equity, Umaru Shittien, contended that the Muslim/Muslim ticket of APC should not be a problem in Nigeria’s politics. Shittien stated this at the inauguration of Tinubu/Shettima Grassroots Independent Campaign Council (ICC) Door-To-Door Campaign coordinators of the 17 local councils, in Jos, Plateau State, yesterday. CONECDA’s presentation was made to Tinubu’s wife, Oluremi, yesterday during her visit to Jos where she met with the leadership of the indigenous groups, Christian religious leaders and also held a Town Hall meeting with stakeholders.
