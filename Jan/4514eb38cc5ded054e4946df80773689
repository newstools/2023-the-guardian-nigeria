Kwara State government is set to unveil 10 modern glass squash courts at the state’s stadium complex in Ilorin.
According to the chairman of Kwara State Sports Commission, Bola Magaji, the modern arenas, which are the highest number situated in one location in Nigeria and West Africa, are currently being constructed by the state government to continue improving the standard of the sport in the state. He noted that Kwara State, which has produced stars in squash and also dominated the sport across Nigeria in recent times, needed to upgrade its facilities and other sports arenas at the state stadium to meet modern athletics demands. He added that Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq is focusing on transforming Kwara State to Nigeria’s hub of sports. “The two courts initially at the stadium have been renovated and the government is adding eight more courts that would accommodate singles and doubles events. It will be ready for use very soon. “This facility has not been seen at the moment in any state in Nigeria and West Africa. Kwara State is known for outstanding performance in squash. Most of our athletes were used by other states at the 2022 National Sports Festival at Asaba, which shows the state’s commitment to the sport.” Magaji, a former national squash champion, said that apart from the squash courts, other facilities at the Ilorin Stadium are being renovated to help athletes hone their skills in an organised environment. “We have 32 active sports in Kwara State and all facilities to make athletes excel is being put in place. “The state government is also working hard to prepare the basketball team for continental engagements… we are not leaving out the welfare of players and coaches of Kwara United F.C, who are currently playing in the NPFL,” he said.
