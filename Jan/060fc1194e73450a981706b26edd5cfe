• Warn on wrong steps ahead of elections
• It’s significant year for Nigerians, says Ajibola
• ‘How electoral outcome will determine economic progress’
• Inflation, cost of living crisis among major challenges Stakeholders across business communities have said insecurity, financial leakages, free fall of naira, rising debt, and other factors could stall economic progress, as the country heads into elections.  According to him, there’s a need to introduce stimulus packages for non-oil sector development and export of high-value products. He called for a need to reorder channeling of human resource capacities and dynamism of youths with measurable targets and periodic policy impact assessments, while asking politicians to behave themselves during forthcoming elections, aware that politics is just a means to an end, and not the end itself	. Former President of Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN) and professor of economics at Babcock University, Segun Ajibola, noted that 2023 is significant in Nigeria and for Nigerians for many reasons. “The hydra-headed problems of inflation, the international value of the local currency and high unemployment rate should be tamed. Current government policies towards resolving these disequilibrating factors need to be continued and strengthened,” Ajibola said.
  
The professor said removal of petroleum subsidy must be on the front burner, stressing that government must break the monopoly of NNPC on importation of fuel before subsidy removal can have helpful effect in Nigeria.	He noted that supportive actions, such as turnaround maintenance of existing refineries and private sector investment in oil refineries, would help in the long run.
  
Ajibola said current policies and incentives on agriculture and industry need to be effectively implemented, especially as some tax rates are being reviewed upwards.	 
  
Chancellor at Edo-based Mudiame University and Managing Director of Mudiame International Limited, Prof. Sunny Eromosele, said while the current government may not be able to do anything about the state of the economy, choosing right leaders in the general elections is required to improve economic indices. “Looking at the national economy, nothing will change due to political tensions. It may be a standstill until elections are over,” he said. He added that if the new government is well prepared to hit the ground running, the economy could experience a little change in the fourth quarter of the year.
    
“Right policy framework with good intentions can turn the situation around. Considering the war in Ukraine and Russia, and the U.K. and U.S. recession, including the China COVID-19 issue, Nigeria should or must ensure that internal issues are resolved,” Eromosele said. He insisted that local approaches must be deployed to sustain the business of the country.
  
Managing Partner, BBH Consulting, Madaki Omadachi Ameh, noted that 2023 would be a tough year for Nigeria and Nigerians. He disclosed that the election season would bring uncertainties, and government, being in a sitting duck mode, would not help matters.  Adeleke said: “On the political side, Nigerians must realise, in practical terms, that politics determines the policies. The politicians we choose will be our policymakers; hence, as a people, we need to take the 2023 general elections as personal businesses.” He said addressing security challenges is critical, because foreign investors, including Nigerians in the diaspora that could attract economic benefits to the country, are being discouraged.
   
Adeleke said: “In addition to industry scale diversification, there is a need to empower young people to boost local productivity. We must produce what we consume and consume what we produce, if there will be any significant change in our pathetic economic narrative. “There is a need to come down heavily on imports. The administration will come in, and sad as it may be, will be procuring new vehicles. It will be shameful if they leave Nigeria-produced automobiles to procure those manufactured abroad.”
