The Kwara Progressives (TKP), a group within the All Progressive Congress (APC) in Kwara State, has promised to repeat the 2019 Ótógeẹ́ feat used to secure victory for the party. The Convener, Gbenga Oyeyemi, made the pledge in a statement, yesterday. He described the Ótógeẹ́ mantra as a viable vehicle used to send the then ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) out of the state. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported that Ótógẹ́ is the slogan for the political revolution in Kwara in 2019 general elections. Ótógẹ́ (meaning “it is enough” in Yoruba) has been described as an impactful campaign slogan effectively used to end decades of the Saraki political hegemony in Kwara. Oyeyemi, however, said TKP would go on a massive mobilisation for APC candidates across board, adding that no stone would be left unturned to ensure victory for the party. He said TKP, which was birthed on January 3, 2023 at Idofin in Oke-ero Local Council of the state, would embrace a new method of reaching out to the electorate to woo them ahead of the election. According to Oyeyemi, the mission of TKP is to ensure that all APC candidates from the House of Assembly to the governor were returned. In the presidential election, TKP will help secure victory for the six House of Representatives candidates, the three senators and the presidential candidate of the party. He said the group, which cuts across the 16 local councils of the state, would not rest until the message of APC got across the state. He commended the governor for his outstanding performance since elected in 2019, which had made TKP job easier.
