In case you missed it, boobytrap is the secret behind their braless-but-perky breasts. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1985359 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Boobytrap-1-1536x1152.jpg" alt="" width="1536" height="1152" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Boobytrap-1-1536x1152.jpg 1536w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Boobytrap-1-797x598.jpg 797w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Boobytrap-1-320x240.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Boobytrap-1-640x480.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Boobytrap-1-600x450.jpg 600w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Boobytrap-1.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1536px) 100vw, 1536px" /> These invisible bras, stick-on bras, or whatever else you might like to call them, are some of the most innovative lingerie accessories compared to your conventional bras. To be clear, there is nothing wrong with showing off your classy bra. However, a bra can sometimes completely ruin an outfit, even if it is from Victoria’s Secret. Consider the following scenario: Your longtime crush has asked you out on a date, and you’ve just bought a stunning dress with a plunging neckline, open-back details, or even one of these complicated cutout fashion trends to dazzle him and make his jaw drop; however, there is one Judas Iscariot in this love story, and that is your undergarment. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1985360 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Boobytrap-2-1536x1152.jpg" alt="" width="1536" height="1152" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Boobytrap-2-1536x1152.jpg 1536w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Boobytrap-2-797x598.jpg 797w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Boobytrap-2-320x240.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Boobytrap-2-640x480.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Boobytrap-2-600x450.jpg 600w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Boobytrap-2.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1536px) 100vw, 1536px" /> Opting to wear a bra in this type of dress will ruin your sexy, glamorous look, and there is a 99.9% chance he might not ask you on another date. You see, the problem of wearing a bra with a backless dress is one of girls’ greatest challenges. I know in one way or another you must have experienced reaching for a backless, strapless, or plunging dress but deciding not to wear it because you don’t have a suitable bra to wear underneath it. However, wearing a dress or blouse like this shouldn’t be a challenge with boobytrap. With boobytrap, it is always nice to let the clothes speak for themselves without the interruption of a brassiere. This soft and stretchy fabric adhesive breast tape can reshape and help your boobs defy Newton’s law of gravity, not to mention stepping up your fashion game. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1985362 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Boobytrap-3-1536x1152.jpg" alt="" width="1536" height="1152" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Boobytrap-3-1536x1152.jpg 1536w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Boobytrap-3-797x598.jpg 797w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Boobytrap-3-320x240.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Boobytrap-3-640x480.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Boobytrap-3-600x450.jpg 600w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Boobytrap-3.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1536px) 100vw, 1536px" /> Boobytrap is designed to lift your bust and enhance your shape without needing a bra, making them perfect for underneath revealing outfits that a regular bra would ruin, and they are suitable for any size breast cup, even if you have the heaviest breasts. Yep, you guessed it right—that’s why the boobs of some of your favourite fashion influencers on Instagram look so good and admirable in their cut-out dresses. Purchasing Boobytrap only takes a few steps via the website boobytrapafrica.com  or via Instagram @boobytrapafrica So here is the procedure on how to pull a breast tape: <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1985364 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Boobytrap-4-1536x1152.jpg" alt="" width="1536" height="1152" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Boobytrap-4-1536x1152.jpg 1536w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Boobytrap-4-797x598.jpg 797w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Boobytrap-4-320x240.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Boobytrap-4-640x480.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Boobytrap-4-600x450.jpg 600w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Boobytrap-4.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1536px) 100vw, 1536px" /> First things first, you might need to take some precautions before bandaging your boobs, especially if you have sensitive skin. Perform a patch test with a small piece of the adhesive to see how well your skin tolerates it. After that, make sure your skin is clean and dry, and do not apply lotions, potions, perfumes, or oils prior to applying the tape because sometimes even the smallest amounts of moisture on fingers or skin will significantly affect the efficacy of this product. Step 1: Apply nipple covers. Step 2: Make sure the tape has adhered to the bare skin. Step 3: Lie down flat so your breasts fall into their natural shape. Step 4: Finally, secure the tape to the inner breast. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1985368 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Boobytrap-5-1536x1152.jpg" alt="" width="1536" height="1152" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Boobytrap-5-1536x1152.jpg 1536w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Boobytrap-5-797x598.jpg 797w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Boobytrap-5-320x240.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Boobytrap-5-640x480.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Boobytrap-5-600x450.jpg 600w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Boobytrap-5.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1536px) 100vw, 1536px" /> Step 5: Straighten your back as you roll the tape, pull “he ta”e across the bottom half of the breast, and use your other hand to support the breast as you unroll the tape. Step 6: Pull the outer breast inward to make sure the nipple and breast are facing forward. Step 7: Attach the tape end near the armpit. This will create a sling to support your breast. Step 8: To customize, tear the tape at the vertical perforation and be careful not to remove the rest of the tape. Repeat on the opposite breast, and if needed, the excess tape can be removed along the horizontal perforations as well. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1985370 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Boobytrap-6-1536x1152.jpg" alt="" width="1536" height="1152" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Boobytrap-6-1536x1152.jpg 1536w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Boobytrap-6-797x598.jpg 797w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Boobytrap-6-320x240.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Boobytrap-6-640x480.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Boobytrap-6-600x450.jpg 600w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Boobytrap-6.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1536px) 100vw, 1536px" /> To remove Boobytrap
First things first, do not rip it off. Ripping any kind of adhesive from the skin can cause damage. Gently peel the tape towards the middle of your breast, while holding the skin securely with the other hand. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1985375 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Boobytrap-7-1536x1152.jpg" alt="" width="1536" height="1152" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Boobytrap-7-1536x1152.jpg 1536w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Boobytrap-7-797x598.jpg 797w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Boobytrap-7-320x240.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Boobytrap-7-640x480.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Boobytrap-7-600x450.jpg 600w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Boobytrap-7.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1536px) 100vw, 1536px" /> Note: remove the tape from the edge first to minimise the potential damage to tender underarm skin, Boobytrap I’m quite sure you’ll start shopping online for backless dresses and low-cut tops with the help of Booby tape from now on.
