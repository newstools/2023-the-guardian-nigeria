Say camp demolished without prior notice About 3,000 people displaced from  Durumi Internally Displaced Persons’ (IDP) camp located at Durumi, Area 1 in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja,  have cried out for government assistance to ameliorate their plight.  “I beg them in the name of God to fulfill this promise, we are human beings, we are Nigerians, where do they want us to go. Government is taking care of the refugees more than us, they can find a place where they are putting the refugees to keep us too.
 
“As of today, a lot of killings are still going on in Gwoza council. I was there three months ago, it was the military that escorted me to and fro my community, as of two days ago,  they still killed people there, so where do we go now,” she lamented.  MEANWHILE,  ActionAid has handed over blankets, mosquito nets,  cooking utensils as well as   N10,000 to 70 vulnerable households in the camp.
