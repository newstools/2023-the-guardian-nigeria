The former Chief of Air Staff (CAS) told select journalists at his Bauchi residence, on Tuesday night, that systemic denial of quality and affordable education, unequal distribution of the common resources and lack of job opportunities were the major contributors of insecurity being witnessed currently. He said: “I have been managing internal security and I will manage those that generate insecurity. Security and development are two sides of a coin. If you don’t provide schools, you are looking for insecurity; if you don’t allow people to be part of the system, then you are calling for insecurity. ” “If someone comes home hungry and discovers that his sick wife cannot go to hospital and his child cannot go to school; if you are not lucky, he will pick AK-47. That is what we have been managing for 42 years. By God’s grace, we are hoping to create an enabling environment for people to have a sense of belonging. “I have seen that it is possible to change the narrative of Bauchi; all that is required is good intention and commitment to move the state forward.”
