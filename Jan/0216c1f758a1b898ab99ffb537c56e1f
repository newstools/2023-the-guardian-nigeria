A rights activist, Mr. Meliga Godwin, has dragged the Department of State Services (DSS) to a Federal Capital Territory (FCT) High Court, over alleged illegal arrest and detention, constituting a breach of his fundamental rights. Godwin, the President of Middle Belt Youth Forum, on December 19, 2022, addressed the media, where he condemned the DSS for its attempt to obtain an exparte application to arrest and detain the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele over alleged terrorism charges. The activist had, at the media briefing, condemned the actions of the DSS and described it as a hatchet job. In a motion for the enforcement of his fundamental rights with suit No: FCT/HC/CV/1034/2023, filed by his lawyer, Mr. Chibuzo Ezike, Godwin is asking the court for his unconditional release by the DSS. The applicant prayed the court to order his release from detention and also make an order directing the DSS and its director general, who is a party in the suit, to pay him the sum of N500 million as damages. He also prayed the court to order the defendants to issue a public apology in two national dailies for illegal arrest and detention. He further prayed the court to declare his arrest and detention from January 8 till the time of filling the suit as a breach of his fundamental rights, unconstitutional and of no effect.
