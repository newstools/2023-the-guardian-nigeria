People Democratic Party (PDP) senatorial candidate for Kogi Central, Natasha Akpoti-Uduaghan, has promised to work for the resuscitation of Ajaokuta Steel Company (ASC) when she gets to the Senate.
When she took her campaign to Ajaokuta Local Council, during the week, to end her Ward-to-Ward campaign, the lawyer called on the people to come out in their numbers to vote for her and other PDP candidates. She said: “Your action on February 25, 2023, general elections can make ASC work, don’t allow party loyalty to deny us the opportunity to correct past mistakes. “By the special grace of God, this election will be the starting point of a democratic revolution that will bring about reforms to our economy, society and our well-being as a people. God will not come from heaven to change our condition’ let’s take action to change our story.” Akpoti-Uduaghan has been leading the campaign for the revival of ASC in her senatorial district. She had led protests to draw the Federal Government’s attention to the moribund steel plant. On March 1, 2018, as an ordinary citizen, she held the National Assembly to a standstill during a sectoral debate where she exposed the factors militating against the revival of the steel company, and suggested the way forward.
