Ondo State Government on Wednesday charged its workers to be diligent and more committed in discharging their duties. The state’s Commissioner for Finance, Mr Wale Akinterinwa, said this at a prayer session organised by the ministry. Akinterinwa, while urging the workers to continue to handle government property with care, advised them to continue to improve on their performance and be honest with their job. The commissioner appreciated the workers for the level of commitment and cooperation that had made the ministry to be one of the best in the state. “Let’s dress properly to work; let’s dress decently; let’s carry ourselves with dignity, we are people of dignity; we are special people, a peculiar people, so let it reflect in both our appearance and utterances. “Whatever you have done well in 2022, do better this year, whatever you have not done better last year, improve on it this year,” he said. Akinterinwa also urged the workers to continue to pray for Gov. Rotimi Akeredolu for good health and more wisdom “to lead the state to the promised land.” Earlier, in his sermon, Prophet Jide Ekpobomini, prayed for all the workers for a successful and fulfilled year. Ekpobomini, who also doubled as the Permanent Secretary of the ministry, urged the workers to be diligent and to ensure effective service delivery. A member of staff of the ministry, Mrs Funmilayo Ayodele-Adekanbi, who appreciated God for the grace to see 2023, promised to give all her best to ensure a successful year at work. Ayodele-Adekanbi used the occasion to appreciate the state government for payment of the backlog of salaries owed the state workers.
