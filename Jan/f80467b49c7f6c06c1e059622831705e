The junior edition of the annual Central Bank Tennis Tournament will serve off on Monday, February 6, inside the Lagos Lawn Tennis Club, Onikan, Lagos. Many players are arriving the state for the week-long competition. While all eyes would be on Seun Ogunsakin, Murewa Egbeyemi and Success Ogunjobi, most of the youngsters who played at the recently concluded Azimuth Shipping Lines Limited Junior Tennis Championship are expected to participate in this year’s edition of the CBN Juniors and are looking to make their mark at the event. Seun Ogunsakin, in the most recent rankings released by the Confederation of African Tennis, is the number six-ranked U-14 youngster in Africa. The southpaw, who is heading to Tunisia on a sports scholarship, needed just two tournaments to achieve this huge feat. In last year’s edition, Egbeyemi and Ogunjobi emerged the tournament’s Most Valuable Players in the male and female categories respectively. Murewa also won the 10-under title after defeating Dubem Amasiani 9-4 in a one-sided match. The story was not the same for Ogunjobi who, although lost the girls 14 under title to Bright Emmanuel 4-9, was rated as the most improved female player (in her category) by the organisers. Also, the Ogunsakin brothers were the biggest winners as Seyi and Seun beat their opponents in the 12-under and 16-under categories.
Seyi Ogunsakin defeated Husseini Ayoola 9-3. In the Boys 14-under, Joel Benjamin dismissed Joseph Ogunyemi 9-4, while Ndidi Osaji lost to Ndifreke Benjamin 5-9 in the girls 12-under category.
