QNET in a statement by  Biram Fall, its Regional Manager for Sub-Sahara Africa, wholly disassociates itself from such representations and sincerely draws public attention to the fact that it never makes such representations. The firm warned members of the public to be extremely wary of anyone using its name and offering “employment” or “travel opportunities” in exchange for “payment” or “administrative charges. It also pledged its commitment to take legal action against anyone making these false representations to the fullest extent permitted by law and has called on the public to report such activities to the authorities and QNET. QNET is a member of the Direct Selling Association, a self-regulatory industry body with stringent rules and codes of conduct in several countries. The company is open and transparent about its business model and operations and ensures compliance with the local laws of all the countries in which it operates. A 25-year-old Direct Selling company headquartered in Hong Kong, QNET allows aspiring entrepreneurs to build their businesses by becoming distributors, termed independent Representatives (IRs). The company produces and sells high-quality products and services to customers around the globe while also providing an opportunity for aspiring entrepreneurs to build an e-commerce-enabled sales business using its direct selling business opportunity. QNET operates an online global Direct Selling Disinformation Centre (DSDC) to dispel misconceptions, unethical behaviour and public complaints about the sector. From an industry perspective, this is a unique initiative that advocates transparency and good practices. For more information, visit www.directsellingdisinformation.org. In addition, QNET has implemented several initiatives to create opportunities for Nigerian youths, including the FinGreen Financial Literacy programme.
