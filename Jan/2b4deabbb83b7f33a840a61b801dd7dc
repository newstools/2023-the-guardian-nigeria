The All Progressives Congress (APC) has described the decision by the election tribunal to declare Adegboyega Oyetola victorious in the Osun State governorship poll as a victory for democracy and the rule of law. APC in a statement by its national publicity secretary noted that the verdict remains a categorical affirmation of the will of the Osun electorate as expressed at the polls. The party noted: “The peaceful conduct of the Osun governorship election and effective recourse procedures are eloquent testaments to our Party’s commitment to bequeathing a legacy of credible elections, and independent and fair dispensation of electoral justice. “The Tribunal’s findings and verdict on the pivotal question of over-voting yet again underscores the massive significance of the programme of electoral reform and new and efficient technologies implemented by the APC administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.”
