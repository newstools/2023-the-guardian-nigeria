It’s Cheap Blackmail, Says MWUN
Truckers under the aegis of the Council Of Maritime Transport Unions And Associations (COMTUA) have cried out over the outrageous extortions from over 50 illegal checkpoints along the ports access roads in Apapa, Lagos.
   
The group, in a statement by its National President, Adeyinka Aroyewun, alleged that some officers of Maritime Workers Union (MWUN), Lagos State Park and Garages Management, and the Truck Transit Park (TTP) are among those breeding extortions on the port corridor.
 
Aroyewun called for urgent intervention of the government and its agencies to arrest the situation to enhance the ease of doing business at the seaports.  Meanwhile, MWUN, President General, MWUN, Adeyanju Adewale, said that the allegation was sheer blackmail.
 
He said: “MWUN is a partner in growing our economy and ensuring peace in all our ports, terminals, jetties, and oil and gas platforms which informs our unblemished decade-long record of maintaining industrial peace in the maritime sector. Our record is in the public space for all to see.
 
“Short of libelous, Aroyewun assertion that MWUN tolls 20 checkpoints from coconut Bus-Stop to Tin Can Island Gate, a distance of about 1000 meters is a figment of his myopic imagination and a deliberate lie designed to malign our good image,” he said.
