The formal public presentation of takeoff grants to the 20 participating Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) clubs in the 2022/23 season, will hold today at the Sandralia Hotel, Abuja. The ceremony is holding ahead of the new season, which starts on January 8, with Match day one in Groups A and B of the Abridged League format. The Interim Management Committee (IMC) arrived at the date to ensure that the league ends in May to align with the international calendar. Expected at the event are the President of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), Ibrahim Gusau, the leadership of the Nigeria Referees Association (NRA) and other stakeholders. According to the IMC Chairman, Gbenga Elegbeleye, the occasion will afford the Gusau-led NFF opportunity to address stakeholders on the support the football house will bring to upgrade the country’s league to international standards. “The presentation ceremony will have in attendance, the NFF President, Ibrahim Gusau, who wants to address all stakeholders ahead of the start of the season to assure them that the football house will support every move to upgrade our league in terms of transparency, level playing ground and improved performance.’’ “It is also a platform for the IMC to make a public presentation of the takeoff grant to our participating clubs to put them on a good pedestal to start the season,” Elegbeleye stated. The Akwa United versus Bendel Insurance fixture in Uyo will be the flagship centre for the commencement of the NPFL.
