Operatives of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Police Command have reportedly subdued an armed robbery incident in Kabusa outskirts of the FCT.

Some of the exhibits recovered from the scene include one Barreta Pistol, one round of 9mm live ammunition, two axes, one mobile phone, and one silver whistle. “On receipt of the report, the police operatives swiftly mobilised to the scene in collaboration with the locals. The hoodlums, on sighting the police team, opened fire at them, and a gun duel ensued.
