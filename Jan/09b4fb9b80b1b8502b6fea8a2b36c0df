The Chairman of CeBIH, Celestina Appeal, who stated this at a recent conference of the Committee, which was held in Lagos, said the fight against electronic payment fraud, remained the responsibility of all.
  
According to her, the promotion of a unified front in combating fraud through an active collaboration between providers of financial services, law enforcement agencies, the judiciary, and regulators, has become imperative in restoring the confidence of consumers in the Nigerian payment system.
 
She added that CeBIH would remain committed in leading the engagements and interactions with the identified partners to harness capabilities across the ecosystem in order to rid the Nigerian payment system of the menace of fraud.
