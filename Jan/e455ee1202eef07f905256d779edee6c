The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has told the Presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, “to count it out of his problems with President Muhammadu Buhari resulting in his continued attack and pouring of vitriolic on the person of Mr President” The Atiku-Okowa Campaign organization in a statement by its spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan, said “it is indeed pathetic that in less than 24 hours after Tinubu stood on the public stage at his Presidential Rally in Abeokuta, Ogun State, to accuse the Buhari administration of creating fuel scarcity and redesigning the naira to scuttle the 2023 election, he is turning around to blame the PDP for his woes” According to the Atiku campaign,  “it is strange that Asiwaju Tinubu wants the world to believe that his caustic remarks against Buhari were intended for Atiku Abubakar and the PDP when neither Atiku nor PDP is involved in the monetary policies or the failure to arrest the horrifically unending fuel crisis.” The opposition party reminded Tinubu that in accusing the “powers that be” of creating fuel scarcity and hoarding the naira to truncate the election, he knew that President Buhari is the Minister of Petroleum Resources and that all agencies of government in charge of prospecting and distribution of petroleum resources are under his (Buhari) office.” The PDP said that Tinubu also knew that President Buhari approved the redesigning of the naira and that issues of distribution of the naira notes are vested in the APC-controlled Federal Government and not on the PDP. “It is therefore clear that Asiwaju’s verbal assaults against President Buhari is the official position of his confused, disoriented and disorganized Campaign Organization,” the PDP said. “It is noteworthy that having come to the conclusion, by himself, that he does not enjoy the support of President Buhari, having realized that his campaign is now falling apart with its leaders leaving in droves given his manifest rejection by Nigerians, Asiwaju Tinubu now seeks to blackmail the President and incite his followers to violence, with the view of truncating the electoral process and blaming it on President Buhari” the statement added. The PDP further said that Tinubu’s “verbal somersaults within a space of fewer than 24 hours presents him as a person that must not be entrusted with power.”
