Ogun, Lagos, Delta, Bayelsa and 20 other states are participating in the two-day Nigeria School Sports Federation (NSSF)-organised World School Athletics Trials holding at the MKO Abiola Stadium, Abeokuta.
 
The trials, which began on Wednesday, are featuring over 1,248 students in the U-12, U-15 and U-18 categories.
 
Speaking on the event, NSSF President, Olabisi Joseph, said the large turnout of athletes was a confirmation of the support from the states. “I am so excited with the presence of majority of the states, which has again shown that we are in the right direction, because for us at the NSSF, unearthing the talents early is one of our priorities and this tournament will provide us opportunity to achieve this. 
   
“Apart from the competition, the event will afford the students opportunity to relate with their counterparts from across the country. We are bonding our children together and we are also showcasing their talents so that we can select the best that will represent the country at the 2023 World School Athletics Championship in Turkey. “This is how we can check age cheat and allow the children to start early to become world beaters,” she said.
    
Apart from Ogun, Lagos, Rivers, Delta and Bayelsa, other states at the event are Kano, Kaduna, Ekiti, Oyo, Kwara, Osun, Edo, Benue, Imo, Cross River, Akwa Ibom, Kogi, Ondo and FCT Abuja.
