The Department of State Services (DSS) on Thursday morning arrested Doyin Okupe at the Murtala Mohammed International Airport in Lagos. Okupe, a chieftain of the Labour Party (LP), was billed to fly to London via Virgin Atlantic before he was apprehended by DSS personnel. DSS spokesman, Peter Afunanya in a statement said Okupe was intercepted at the instance of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). Okupe, a former presidential aide, later confirmed his arrest at the Lagos airport and release. He said he has been released by the EFCC, and senior officials of the anti-graft commission “apologised” to him for “the error”. Afunanya also said the LP chieftain was handed over to the EFCC. “Doyin Okupe was intercepted by the DSS at Terminal 1 of Murtala Mohammed International Airport, Lagos this (Thursday) morning at the instance of the EFCC,” Afunanya said. “He has long been handed over to the Commission which requested for the action. “Okupe was billed to fly to London via Virgin Atlantic.”
