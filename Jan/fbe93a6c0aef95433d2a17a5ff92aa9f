Kwara State Commandant of Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), Muhammed Ibrahim said the Command has arrested suspected robber and rapist,  Ganiyu Yusuf. He said after the suspect was reported,  he was eventually tracked down at a transit settlement, Mokwa, Niger State on January 5, 2023. The 47-year-old native of Abeokuta, Ogun State  allegedly confessed that he broke into the house on that fateful day through the roof. The Commander added: “After gaining access to the house at Oloje area in Ilorin, he over powered the woman who was alone with her two-year-old baby in the house. He raped the woman in the presence of her two-year-old daughter and went away with two laptops and two android phones belonging to the victim. “The Command is still searching for the buyers of the exhibits.  We are therefore appealing to the public to be conscious of what they buy. The suspect will be taken to court for prosecution immediately.”
