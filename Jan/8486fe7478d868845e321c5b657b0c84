Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) and Boko Haram terrorists have clashed at Tumbum Allura and Kangar camps, killing over 30 fighters in Borno State.  The captives regained their freedom after being abducted by ISWAP along Maiduguri-Gajiram Road on August 3, 2022.
Those freed included a medical personnel working with one of the humanitarian agencies.
 
“I narrowly escaped from ISWAP prison and scampered for safety, while they  engaged rival terror groups  in a fierce gun battle for over a dozen hours,” said the health personnel.
 
Makama stated that the escaped prisoners sneaked into a neighbouring country through the forest in the Lake Chad Basin.
 
According to the military source, they will be handed over to the authorities for further action after being profiled by ground troops.
