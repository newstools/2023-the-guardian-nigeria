Premium Beer brand Guinness is proud to announce the successful completion of their Dear Football Fans campaign. Launched in November 2022, the campaign aimed to celebrate and connect with football fans across Nigeria through a series of weekly trivia, digital events and, activations that brought together fans, superfans and, celebrities.
 
The campaign was a resounding success, with 7.7 million football fans engaging the Dear football fans Question of the week across social media and a unique reach of over 31 million on social media across all campaign events.
 
The campaign highlight was the Guinness Dear Football fans match, where the winners shared footage from the Chelsea vs. Manchester City EPL game across their social media to proclaim it the best football experience of their lives. Live at the Stamford Bridge Stadium on the 5th of January 2023, The Dear Football fans winners demonstrated how Guinness holds the hands of football fans in times of heightened emotions and celebration to make the experience brighter for all to enjoy. Speaking on the campaign, Mark Mugisha, Marketing and Innovations, Director “At Guinness, we believe that football brings people together and creates a sense of community, and we are honoured to be a part of that experience.”
