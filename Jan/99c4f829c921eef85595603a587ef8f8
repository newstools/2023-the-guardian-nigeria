Delta State Governor and Vice Presidential Candidate of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, has congratulated the Owhorode of Olomu Kingdom, Richard Layieguen, Ovie Ogoni-Oghoro I, on his 106th birthday. In a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Olisa Ifeajika, in Asaba, Okowa lauded the renowned monarch for his contributions to the prevalence of peace in the state. He said that since ascending the ancient throne of his forebears, the reign of the monarch, who is also the Chairman of Urhobo Traditional Rulers, has been very beneficial to his kingdom in particular, and Urhobo people in general. According to the governor, the Olomu monarch has, in the past 35 years on the throne, contributed immensely to the growth and development of his kingdom and the Urhobo people, and deserves to be celebrated on this special occasion of his birth anniversary. He joined the royal family, the people of Olomu Kingdom at home and in the Diaspora and the entire Urhobo nation in celebrating the centenarian monarch, describing him as a “bridge-builder, quintessential elder statesman and royal cannon, who had attained a great landmark age in his journey of life.” Okowa prayed that God would continue to bless the notable traditional ruler with greater wisdom, good health and strength to continue leading the people of his kingdom. “We pray that the Almighty God will continue to bless you with more wisdom and good health as you continue to ensure that your domain is peaceful for the growth and development of your people, the Urhobo and their neighbours,” the governor stated.
