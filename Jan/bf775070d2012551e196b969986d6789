A Lagos-based accountant, 24, Hussain Kehinde Garuba has emerged as the latest landlord in Lagos as he received keys to his three-bedroomed house courtesy of Globacom’s festival of joy promo. The graduate of Lagos State Polytechnic revealed this at the weekend that his aunt had prophesied that a good thing was on the way for him barely 24 hours before he received the news that he had won a house prize in the ongoing customer-reward promo by the telecommunications giant. Glo Festival of Joy promo offers 20 houses and thousands of other amazing prizes including 24 brand new cars, power generators, sewing machines and rechargeable fans to subscribers to reward their loyalty to the network since its inception in 2003. “I was stunned when I got that call. I just wasn’t expecting something as big as that coming my way so early in the year”, he said at the presentation ceremony. He added that though it had always been his heart’s cry to have his own house in Lagos, he never knew the desire would manifest soon hence his focus on the completion of his ICAN certification by next year. Said he: “I could barely sleep last night as I kept pondering what Glo has done to me,” adding, “I would forever cherish the network”. Garuba’s friends and family members dramatically turned the venue of the presentation to a carnival ground singing and dancing to the  fortune of their  relation. Lagos State Commissioner for Science and Technology, Hakeem Fahm, who came as special guest showered praises on Globacom for putting smiles on the faces of its customers across the country. He added: “What Globacom is doing is an incredible act of generosity, and it is worthy of emulation”.
 Globacom’s Regional Manager, Jude Jacobs, encouraged Glo subscribers to opt into the promo by dialing *611# and continue recharging their lines to be eligible to win the various prizes.
