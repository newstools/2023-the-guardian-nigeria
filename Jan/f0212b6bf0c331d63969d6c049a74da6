Former President Olusegun Obasanjo, has commiserated with Dr Akinwunmi Adesina, the President, African Development Bank (AfDB) over the death of his mother, Mrs Eunice Adesina. The former president in a letter addressed to Adesina, said late Eunice was a hardworking personality, who dedicated her life to her family and the church of Christ. He said the deceased, who passed away on Dec. 22, 2022 at the age of 92, lived a fulfilled life, adding that her impact on her family was evident in the achievements of her children. “It is with sadness I read the passing on to glory of Mama, Chief, Mrs Eunice Adesina. “On behalf of my family, please accept our profound condolences and prayers as you go through the permanence of her absence. `The loss of a mother is never an easy moment to bear, you should, however, be consoled as she lived a life of lessons, hard work and dedication,’’ he said. Obasanjo said the grace of God, which Eunice enjoyed with her late husband, Mr Roland Adesina, led to the impact they made before their demise. While urging the bereaved to take solace in the fact that she had contributed her quota to human development, the former president said, “mama was one in a million. “The evidence of her motherhood is well reflected on her children and daughters-in-law. “I can attest to the fact that her children and you in particular are men of strong character and great achievements in their respective rights. “Those of you she left behind should be comforted even as you celebrate her time on earth.’’ Obasanjo said while all mankind would take same path someday, it was important to be prepared for what one would be remembered for.
