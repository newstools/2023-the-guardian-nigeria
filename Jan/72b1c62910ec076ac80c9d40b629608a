The Director, Media and Publicity of the Anyichuks Grassroots Support Organisation (AGSO), Abia Onyike, yesterday, denied reports in some media that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has delisted the name of its governorship candidate,  Ifeanyi Odii, and other Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidates from contesting the forthcoming general elections in Ebonyi State. In a statement, in Abakaliki, Onyike described the reports as false and a mere propaganda. He, therefore, urged the public to ignore the reports, saying it is the handiwork of mischief-makers in the society. According to the statement, Onyike said it is an orchestrated campaign of calumny masterminded by those individuals and parties, who are afraid of the rising profile of PDP in the state. He said: “Our attention has been drawn to the fake news being circulated by some media platforms and the social media saying that the names of Ebonyi  PDP candidates have been delisted in the INEC portal, based on what they termed as  “court order.” As INEC has already disowned the reports, we call on our supporters and the general public to ignore the mischievous publications and continue their preparations for the 2023 general elections. “It is well known by all and sundry that the issue of Ebonyi PDP governorship primary had been settled at the Supreme Court of Nigeria, which upheld the nomination of Dr. Ifeanyi Odii as the authentic governorship candidate of PDP for the 2023 elections. “Those behind the falsehood are merely looking for temporary relief, based on their fear of PDP candidates, especially the governorship candidate of the party, and sooner than later, they will have no room, whatsoever, for their lies and propaganda.”
