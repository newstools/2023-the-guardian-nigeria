Delta State Government, yesterday, dismissed reports it denied Labour Party (LP) venue for its presidential campaign rally in the state. According to the state Commissioner for Information, Mr. Charles Aniagwu, in a statement in Asaba, LP never applied officially for any venue. He said a representative of the party only spoke to him via telephone call, yesterday morning, and made demand to make use of the Arcade in Asaba. Aniagwu stated that the state government immediately reached out to the Oshimili South Council and secured a waiver of all formalities and made the venue available for the party to hold its presidential rally. He said the state further demonstrated its democratic disposition and tolerance for opposition by waiving the amount payable for the venue, urging the LP to carry on its rally peacefully in line with rules and regulations.
