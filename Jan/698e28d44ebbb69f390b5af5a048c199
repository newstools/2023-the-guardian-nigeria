A presidential member of the American Association of Christian Counsellors, Dr. Stephanie Oarhe, has said that the rising spate of social vices and failed society has been linked to the problem of dysfunctional families, which could only be addressed through family courts. Oarhe, who disclosed this in her acceptance speech after her appointment by the wife of the River State Governor, Justice Eberechi Wike into the Rivers State Family Court  as a family counsellor, said the court is designed to bring forth a holistic family for a better society.
   
The governor’s wife, who is also the presiding chief judge of the family court, announced Oarhe’s appointment during the four-day family court lecture that preceded the official inauguration of the court in Port Harcourt.
 
Speaking on the importance of the family court and what she is bringing into the ministry, Dr. Oarhe said: “Family courts are important because of the importance of family in raising a child – a dysfunctional family will result in a dysfunctional society,  and the family court is designed to bring forth a holistic family for a better society.
 
“Family courts are courts established to hear cases related to family and domestic relationships. They also address child custody cases and divorce. They make decisions and give orders in court concerning conflicts related to marriage or divorce and child custody.
 
“The three main important duties of the family court, when it comes to children, are to rehabilitate, reinforce and reintegrate the children.” The inaugural lecture was rounded off with the hosting of the Minister of Women Affairs and Social Development, Dame Pauline Tallen, the state Commissioner of Social Welfare and Rehabilitation, Mrs. Inime Chinwenwo-Aguma among other stakeholders.
