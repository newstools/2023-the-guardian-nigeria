From time immemorial, Africa, particularly Blacks have been conspiratorially labelled inferior by the Western world and Western democracies, who for instance see no good in our political culture and history and continue to propagate that they parade the best and superior form of governance to which we are subservient and must therefore subscribe to. They have succeeded in this mischievous enterprise because they have been able to deploy successfully, the most potent weapon of “mass destruction” with its multiple missiles of mis-information, dis-information, under-reporting and mis-reporting and documentation of events in Africa and the Diaspora. Some scholars have also described this as instrument of mass distortion.
   
It is however heart-warming that several decades ago Pan-Africanists among who were late J. K. Aggrey and Walter Rodney had long realised this conspiracy and had spoken and written to debunk it, to put the record straight. Rodney did much on this in his famous book, “How Europe Under-developed Africa”. So also Aggrey in his famous “Black and White Piano Key-board Theory”, where he convincingly proved that it is only when the black and white buttons on a piano are played together that the best and a harmonious rhyme could be obtained.
   
Apart from Rodney and Aggrey, numerous contemporary African scholars and historians have successfully debunked the inferiority gospel of the Western world and claim that Africans have no tangible development worthy of celebrating. Some of these scholars have made references to the then very prosperous Oyo Empire and the then very flourishing Benin Empire which respectively, paraded one of the best form of governance, including effective institutions of checks and balances and succession without hitches.
