Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, has said that Nigeria should not be left in the hands of terrorists in 2023 again, tasking the citizens to join the vanguard to rescue the country from all forms of malaise. This is a veiled statement against the Buhari-led government by Ortom, who is one of the most vocal critics of the Federal Government on the handling of security. In his new year message, yesterday, in Makurdi, Benue State Governor, canvassed for an egalitarian society where every citizen is free to ply his or her legitimate trade according to the dictates of the law and order in any part of the country without fear of molestation or intimidation. The governor prayed for a new Nigeria where peace and security will be guaranteed. Ortom stated that it has become imperative that citizens refrain from mundane issues of religious or ethnic biases just as he enjoined the Federal Government to strive to address issues of insecurity threatening the corporate existence of Nigeria in a manner that gives everyone hope and comfort. He decried the unpalatable security situation in 2022, imploring security agents and men of goodwill to do more to arrest the deteriorating situation in a manner akin to saying “Enough is Enough. “Never again should Nigeria be left in the hands of terrorists in 2023 and beyond for the benefit of generations yet unborn.” He further said that the state government has strengthened the Benue State Community Volunteer Guards and Livestock Guards with more vehicles and motorcycles to complement the services of the conventional security agencies in the state to contain the activities of terrorists and criminals in the state. Ortom wished Nigerians a peaceful and prosperous new year in 2023 that promises prosperity in spite of the security and economic challenges facing the nation.
