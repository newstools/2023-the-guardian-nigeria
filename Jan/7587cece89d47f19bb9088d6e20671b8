Atiku engages tricycle riders in Kano About 5,000 women from different parts of Kebbi State have expressed readiness to vote the All Progressives Congress (APC). This was disclosed, yesterday, at the womenâ€™s wing governorship campaign flag-off in Argungu Local Council of the state. But in Kano State, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, has engaged thousands of commercial tricyclists to drive home his campaign strategy to the hinterlands. Apart from soliciting the support of the riders, Atiku pledged to ease the burden associated with their working environment, if voted to power.
Leader of the Kebbi women and wife of the Kebbi State Governor, Dr. Zainab Bagudu, said that the women were ready to give APC thousands of votes. She commended the party leadership for streamlining the campaign in the state, assuring them of her commitment towards mobilising women. Atiku made the promises while addressing the riders in Kano as part of his strategic campaign. Represented by his special assistant, Baraka Sani, the former vice president said, if voted, he would reduce their tax burden and provide entrepreneurship skill for those willing to venture into other trades. Atiku stressed that many of the riders, who were supposed to pursue their education but found themselves with no alternative, would be supported with scholarship to further their education. He also pledged to provide soft loans to support their chosen careers.
