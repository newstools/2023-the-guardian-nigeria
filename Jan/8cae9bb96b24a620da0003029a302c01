A witness told newsmen that eight other persons were seriously injured and were taken to a hospital for treatment in an attack that took place on Thursday. He said: “Some of the victims were beheaded and their heads taken away. The bushes are still being combed in search of more victims. “A man, his wife and four children were all killed in the attack. “The casualty figure may likely rise as three other persons were shot and may not survive the injuries to their chests.” Benue police spokesman, SP Sewuese Anene confirmed the attack, adding that the casualty figure was yet to be ascertained.
