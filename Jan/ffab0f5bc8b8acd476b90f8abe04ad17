The National Horticultural Research Institute (NIHORT) has warned Nigerians to desist from using carbide to ripen bananas due to its health implications. The General Manager, NIHORT Ventures Limited, Dr. Joel Akinfisoye, gave the warning during a four-day women and youth empowerment programme in horticulture, plantain and banana establishment and telfairia production, in Lafia, Nasarawa State. Dr. Akinfisoye said the institute had warned those in the practice of using carbide to desist because of the health implications on consumers. “There are simple ways banana ripes easily. Allow the banana to be mature from the tree and then, tie it in an enclosure that prevents air entry and within a short time, it will ripe naturally,” he said. Addressing the 50 participants at the training, Director, NIHORT, Dr. Mohammed Lawal, noted that plantain and banana and telfairia value chain development is valuable for nutritional and social economic security for millions of Nigerians. “Plantain and banana are important staple food crops and sources of income, especially for small-scale farmers. It can also serve as industrial raw materials for beverage industries producing baby food. “The commodities are commercially viable and money-making spinners for those who understand the value chain. Lawal noted that to maximise the potential of the commodities, capacity building and training is essential to scale up the cultivation. He also explained that over 4,000 people across the country have been trained and empowered with innovations in the cultivation of commodities. The trainees at the workshop commended Senator Abdullahi Adamu for bringing the training to them. One of the participants, Chindo Ibrahim, said he has learnt how to plant and maintain bananas. “The training is an eye opener to us and I will certainly put into practice all I have learnt to improve my economic welfare, says Mrs Rabiu Mohammed, a participant.
