The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar’s daughter, Hauwa Atiku-Uwais; Ogun State PDP Youth Leader, Sunkanmi Oyejide and other party cohorts have appealed to young Nigerians to vote for the party for a better nation. The appeal was made at a South-West youth symposium in Abeokuta, Ogun State capital, organised by PDP New Generation to sensitise  youths on the need to vote for Atiku. They, therefore, urged Nigerian youths to ensure Atiku emerged victorious by voting for him en-masse. Atiku-Uwais, who stated that Nigerians needed a president with track record of excellence in public and private sectors, said that the youth symposium was organised to open up discourse on nation-building. “We need a president that can guarantee and secure our future. We need a president who can restructure Nigeria, as well as a leader who is an advocate for true federalism,” she said. “My fellow compatriots, you will all agree with me that as it stands today, Nigeria is sick and the only prescribed antibiotics that this country needs is Atiku Abubakar,” she said. On his part, Olusola-Eleka hinted that there is need for youths to mobilise, educate and enlighten people about Atiku-Okowa project for the party’s victory at the February 25, 2023 polls.
