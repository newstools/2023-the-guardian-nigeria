A six-year-old student shot and wounded a teacher during an altercation inside a first-grade classroom in the United States. No students were injured in the shooting at Richneck Elementary School, in the city of Newport News in the US state of Virginia, police said. The teacher — a woman in her 30s — suffered life-threatening injuries. Newport News Police Chief Steve Drew, according to multiple reports, said that the teacher’s condition had improved “somewhat” by late afternoon. Reports quoted the police as saying that the child had a handgun in the classroom and that they took that student into custody. “We did not have a situation where someone was going around the school shooting,” Drew told reporters. “We have a situation in one particular location where a gunshot was fired.” He added that the shooting was not an accident. Newport News is a city of about 185,000 people in southeast Virginia. School officials have already said that there will be no classes at the school on Monday.
