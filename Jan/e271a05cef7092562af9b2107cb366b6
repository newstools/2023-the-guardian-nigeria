The Social Democratic Party (SDP) candidate for the House of Assembly, Ikeja Constituency I, Mr. Olakunle Kosile, has donated two newly-built boreholes to residents of the community to boost their access to potable water. Kosile, while speaking at the commissioning, said the project would mitigate the challenge of water in the area.
He, therefore, solicited support of the residents and expressed readiness to provide selfless service to the people. He said: “I came to the community few months ago and  the people told me that one of their major problems was travelling a long distance to get water. Despite being close to the airport, minimal infrastructural development is not in place.  I am a businessman who is in politics, beyond this, we will do more. We will keep empowering the local communities.” A resident in the community,  Mr. Sylvester Njemanze, observed that before the construction of the borehole, life has been difficult for the people, adding that the project will solve the water challenge in the community. For Adekunle Olarenwaju and Usang Emmanuel, who are also residents in the community, they thanked the facilitator for constructing the borehole and providing jobs and skills for youths and women. Also speaking, the Youth President of Opebi, appealed to the facilitator to replicate the borehole project at Opebi area.
