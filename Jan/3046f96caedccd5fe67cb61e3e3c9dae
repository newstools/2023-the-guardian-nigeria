Police in Enugu State have burst a criminal gangâ€™s hideout on Onitsha Road, Enugu where they recovered two assault rifles, one English-made and one locally-fabricated pump action gun. They also recovered one double-barrelled gun, 349 live ammunition of 7.62mm calibre, 25 live cartridges, a hammer, one battle axe head, four machetes, two bottles of perfumes and objects suspected to be charms.

Police spokesman in Enugu State, DSP Daniel Ndukwe, stated in Enugu on Sunday that the sting operation was conducted on the same day the criminals snatched the tricycle.
