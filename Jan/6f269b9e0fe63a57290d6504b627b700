The Emir of Katsina, Abdulmumini Usman, has thrown his weight behind the gubernatorial bid of the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate in the state, Dr. Dikko Radda. Usman, in a statement, described Dikko as a blood relative of his; hence, the support for him. He stated this when the APC gubernatorial candidate and some key party members, visited his palace recently as part of the party’s campaign. The statement issued, yesterday, by the Director, Media and Publicity,
Katsina State APC Campaign Council, Ahmed Abdulkadir, noted that candidates of other political parties had approached the emir for his support. The statement reads: “He said several politicians had approached him for support, but he declined, saying that Dr. Dikko Radda was his blood relative and he had decided to support him during the 2023 election. “Earlier, the APC gubernatorial candidate had told the Emir some of the things contained in his policy document that were geared towards lifting the living standards of the less privileged in the society.”
