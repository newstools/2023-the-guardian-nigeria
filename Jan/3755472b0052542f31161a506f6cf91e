Private companies in Edo State are connecting to the 95MW Ossiomo Power Plant in Edo State, providing a leeway for businesses to maintain stable electricity supply to boost their business, increase productivity and contribute to state’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). According to a statement by the Special Assistant, Media Projects, Edo State Government, Crusoe Osagie, the plant is an electricity generation and distribution company that came into existence, following Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), sealed between the  government and the private power firm. The firm provides between 18 and 24 hours of electricity daily to government establishments, private companies and also powers the state’s government light-up Edo project, involving streetlights across the Benin metropolis. Some of the businesses connected to Ossiomo Power Plant include Benin Owena River Basin Development Authority; Edo Production Centre; the 5500bpd Edo Modular Refinery; Phil Hallmark Supermarkets; Nigeria Observer Premises; NUJ Secretariat and Benin Club and Golf Course, among others. University of Benin Teaching Hospital (UBTH); Constantial Hotel; Lily Hospitals; Benin Airport and Westview Hotels are about to be connected.Ossiomo Power Plant, the statement adds, also provides dedicated power to the Benin Enterprise Park and some churches in the  metropolis. A lecturer and public analyst at the University of Benin, Mr. Ikponmwosa Nosakare, noted that access to electricity remained a major factor in production, adding that the availability of Ossiomo Power plant in the state will boost businesses operations. He said: “It makes perfect business sense to invest in Edo because there is very little to worry about electricity. This, perhaps, remains one of the most iconic things the government has done to attract investors to the state. I have no doubt that the project will contribute immensely to boosting the state’s Internally Generated Revenue and impact on its Gross Domestic Product.”
