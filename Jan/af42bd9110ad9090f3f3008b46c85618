The Peoples Democratic Party’s (PDP) presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, said his All Progressives Congress (APC) counterpart, Bola Tinubu, has become frustrated by his inability to stop the cashless policy and currency redesign of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) that will curb vote buying and enhance the credibility of next month’s election.

For a man who claimed to have singlehandedly made Buhari president, it is funny that he is now running from pillar to post all in a bid to save what is left of his failed campaign.”
