The Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) yesterday closed on a bearish note as the capitalisation dipped by N134 billion, following losses in Airtel Africa Plc and 15 stocks.
In summary, the All-Share Index (ASI) declined by 246.48 absolute points, representing a drop of 0.48 per cent, to close at 51,446.60 points. Similarly, the overall market capitalisation value shed N134 billion to close at N28.022 trillion.
The market loss was driven by price depreciation in large and medium capitalised stocks amongst which are; Airtel Africa, Nigerian Exchange Group (NGXGroup), Champion Breweries, NEM Insurance and UAC of Nigeria (UACN). Analysts said the bears resumed activities on stocks yesterday, as investors booked profits from the extended rally. United Capital Plc, said: “The Central Bank of Nigeria’s recent CRR debits in the money market will likely discourage investors from sustaining investment in equities in the short-term as they hope for improvement in money market yields. “However, we see any downturn as a short-term buying opportunity as we expect investors’ risk-on sentiments will linger through Q1, 2023, favouring the equities market, as the prevailing downward pressure interest rates will persist through the quarter.” Vetiva Dealings and Brokerage said: “Trades in large cap stocks dictated market direction once again and despite a relatively positive market breadth, the session closed in the red. Barring any major decline in the heavy weights tomorrow, we expect to see slight recovery in the market.” As measured by market breadth, market sentiment was positive, as 18 stocks gained relative to 16 losers.
