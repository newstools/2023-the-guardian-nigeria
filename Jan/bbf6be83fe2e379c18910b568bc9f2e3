The presidential candidate of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, yesterday, said youths and women empowerment will form one of his administration’s policies if elected president, saying that the eight years of the All Progressives Congress (APC) have collapsed the country. He further stated his desire to devolve powers to states and councils, noting that such will revive the economy and encourage youths to be self-employed rather than roam the street in search of non-existent jobs. The former vice president, who stated these at the PDP presidential campaign rally, held at PA Ngele Oruta Township Stadium, Abakaliki, Ebonyi State capital, assured the people of South East that under him as president, the issue of insecurity and marginalisation would be a thing of the past. According to him, since the formation of the party and return to democracy, Ebonyi has remained PDP state. He, therefore, urged people of the state to vote him and other candidates at all levels. Addressing party supporters, National Chairman of PDP, Senator Iyiocha Ayu, stated that the developmental strides recorded in the state since 1999 were under the party during the administrations of Dr. Sam Egwu and Martin Elechi despite governor David Umahi’s defection to the APC. Ayu, who stated that Ebonyi is blessed with good governors under the party, urged the people to return to the fold. The Director General of Atiku-Okowa Presidential Campaign Council and governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Tabuwal, said the party’s candidate would transform the country and fixed the economy. The governorship candidate of the party in the state, Dr. Ifeanyi Odii, promised to make the state the preferred investment destination, stimulate opportunities for growth and improve the livelihood, as well as capacity of the people.
