The Presidential Candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has commended and paid gratitude to members of the Nigerian Armed Forces on the occasion of this year’s Armed Forces Remembrance Day. Tinubu, in a statement, in Abuja, said: “The nation owes members of the armed forces – past and present – a huge debt of gratitude for keeping the country together as one and defending its territorial integrity even at the risks of their lives. “It is praiseworthy that despite the many threats and challenges faced by the nation at different junctures of her history, the Armed Forces have remained a great shield that has consistently fought against any threat to national security and peaceful coexistence. “As we celebrate this year’s Armed Forces Remembrance Day January 15, I want to place on record our deep appreciation of the services of our Armed Forces men, past and present. “I want to assure our veterans and those in active service that if elected president I will join hands with them in ensuring that Nigeria defeats every threat to her nationhood.” Tinubu pledged to adequately support them and prioritise their welfare and equipment needs among other empowerment initiatives as already enumerated in the action plan for a “Renewed Hope” for a better and more secure Nigeria. “I congratulate members of the Nigerian Legion and the entire Armed Forces on this memorable day. Let me restate here that we don’t take your service for granted. We remain indebted to you for your sacrifice,” Tinubu said, in the statement.
