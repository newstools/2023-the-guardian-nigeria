• White Paper recommends tax to limit Use of IPv4 Pace of migration from Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) to IPv6, especially within Africa, has been ranked lowest compared to other continents.  The previous generation of IP, IPv4, was released in1981 and used 32-bit (4-byte) addresses to provide 4.3 billion addresses. But with the explosion of computer devices, IPv4 addresses have been allotted. Therefore, the Internet standardisation organisation, IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force), began to plan the next generation of IPv4 protocols in1990. In addition to addressing the shortage of IP addresses, the new protocol needs to develop more extensions. In 1994, the IETF formally proposed an IPv6development plan. In 1998, IPv6 was officially released by the IETF.
   
An IPv6 address consists of 128 bits. In order of magnitude, the capacity of IPv6 addresses is about 8 x 1028 times that of IPv4addresses, reaching 2128 addresses. This not only solves the problem of the number of network address resources, but also provides a foundation for the development of the Internet of Things.
  
Secretary-General, ATU, John Omo, said providing more addresses is not the only advantage of IPv6, it is also the basis for innovation and security of the Internet.
Omo said in 2016, the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) stopped requiring IPv4 compatibility in new or extended Internet protocols. In other words, new protocols for the Internet will be optimized for and depend onIPv6. This means that the IPv4 networks will stop evolving and updating. It also means that the IPv4 networks will be more vulnerable to new security threats.
