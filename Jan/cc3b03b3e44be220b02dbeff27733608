President of Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Yakubu Chonoko Maikyau (SAN), has restated readiness of the association to ensure justice for slain Omobolanle Raheem and Gafaru Buraimoh, both killed separately last month by officers attached to Ajiwe Police Station in Ajah, Lagos State.
NBA’s National Publicity Secretary, Akorede Habeeb Lawal, in a statement, made the vow during the valedictory court session for retired Chief Judge of Kwara State, SD Kawu, who bowed out of the judiciary after 38 years of service. Maikyau said: “The NBA, under my leadership, is determined that the status quo must change. There must be consequences for any life taken by the police, not just for the likes of Omobolanle, who was a lawyer, but also even more for the likes of Gafaru, who is not a lawyer. Gafaru represents the ordinary Nigerians, who have no one to speak for them; their stories never make the headlines, nor get the attention of the Attorney General, the governor or Inspector General of Police.” These are the ones whose families are frustrated by the police in their quest for justice as they keep having doors shut on their faces until they go home and leave it for God. It is for such persons that we must speak and fight to ensure that justice is done in their cases.” Suggesting solutions to extra-judicial killings by police officers, the NBA president stated that speedy prosecutions of murder cases would serve as deterrent to others. He noted that lawyers in the force would have been prepared for the assignment, regretting that most of the fellows are not well placed to aid the police in this very important process.
