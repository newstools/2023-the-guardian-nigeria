The bulls strengthened their hold on the equities sector of the Nigerian capital market, yesterday, as gains in Airtel Africa, Nigerian Breweries and 16 others lifted capitalisation by N257 billion. At the close of the transaction, the all-share-index (ASI) rose by 470.74 points, representing an increase of 0.92 per cent to close at 51,693.08 points. Also, the overall market capitalisation value gained N257 billion to close at N28.156 trillion. The upturn was impacted by gains recorded in medium and large capitalised stocks, amongst which are; Airtel Africa, Nigerian Breweries, United Capital, Nigerian Exchange Group (NGXGroup) and Africa Prudential. Analysts at United Capital Plc anticipated that the bears would resume activities across counters, as investors book profits from the extended rally. According to United Capital, the Central Bank of Nigeria’s recent Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) debits in the money market would likely discourage investors from sustaining investment in equities in the short term as they foresee improvement in money market yields. “However, we see any downturn as a short-term buying opportunity as we expect investors’ risk-on sentiments will linger through Q1,2023, favouring the equities market, as the prevailing downward pressure interest rates will persist through the quarter.” Vetiva Dealing and Brokerage said: “As expected, the week started with some profit taking especially in the banking sector, while today’s positive performance was largely due to the rebound in AIRTELAFRI. We anticipate a bearish close tomorrow, as investors continue to take profit.” Market sentiment, as measured by market breadth, was positive as 18 stocks gained, relative to 16 losers.
