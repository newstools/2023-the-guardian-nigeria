Helen Oritsejafor, wife of former President, Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) and founder, Word of Life Bible Church, Pastor Ayo Oritsejafor, has threatened a lawsuit against two national newspapers for libel. In a statement made available to The Guardian, said: “My attention has been drawn to the fake and malicious news making rounds on blogs, social media platforms and the newspapers against my character and that of my family. It is totally unbelievable, reprehensible and unthinkable, and it is important that I make the facts clear. “I am a wife, a mother and a woman of God, and I uphold the tenets of my Christian faith and marriage. My family and home is the most important part of my life. “I, therefore, appeal to everyone to put our interest and that of our lovely kids above the need to profit from this baseless endeavour. My husband and I are not divorced unless people get divorced on social media and I have never been unfaithful to my husband, whom I love very dearly.” She added: “These are works of the devil and his agents to dent my character and good works. Over the years, I have committed my time and resources towards reaching out to the needy, providing support to widows and giving scholarships to orphans. I have also taught and mentored a lot of young women on the principles of building and living happily with their spouses through my various platforms both on and offline. I cannot go against my own beliefs. “Don’t forget that life is a seed. To carry baseless news not supported with facts is not only malicious but punishable under the law of the land. “I plead with the general public to give my family the privacy it needs and disregard cheap attempts to dent my image. In retrospect to the fake news, I have briefed my lawyers and all necessary legal actions are being taken”, she stated.
