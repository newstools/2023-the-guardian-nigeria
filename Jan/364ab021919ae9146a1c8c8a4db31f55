• Old Students spends N20m on indigent students, others It was a nostalgic homecoming for Bayero University Kano (BUK) graduating class of 1992 when they converged from various walks of life to mark the 30th graduation anniversary of their exit from the institution.  Spokesperson for the group, Mr. ElYakub Shehu said: “Through the online group which reunites us, it has been easy to know what is happening to members, their environment, identifying those in a precarious situation and provide them timely assistance.
 
“It is gladdening to observe that our members work in various sectors including academic, judiciary, business, politics, security and diplomatic services, among others.”
  
Also, in his remark, Publisher of PM Nigeria and Economic Confidential, Mallam Yushau Shuaib, said their yearly get-together is a platform for members to show brotherly love towards one another.
 
A former lecturer of the set, who was in attendance at the event, Professor Aliyu Dauda, stated that throughout his decades of teaching experience, he is yet to come across a class that is so humane, considerate and sympathetic, as the BUK Class of 1992, especially in the areas of community and other interventions to the university.
