President Muhammadu Buhari has assured of Nigeria’s commitment to support the Republic of Burundi in diverse ways, in the spirit of African solidarity and brotherliness. The President spoke, yesterday, at the State House, Abuja, when he received the Special Envoy of President Evariste Ndayishimiye, who came with a message. Audace Niyonzima, Minister of Finance, Budget and Economic Planning of Burundi, said his President sent goodwill for the new year to Nigerians and President Buhari, and also wishes the country well in general elections scheduled for February and March, this year. “We pray that the polls would be peaceful and successful, so that Nigeria would maintain her reputation as a bastion of peace and stability,” the Special Envoy said. On request for assistance in the area of energy provision, particularly fuel, by the Burundi leader, Buhari said he knows what it feels like for a country to suffer from energy shortage and promised that he would get the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited to look into the request. Buhari said he was looking forward to the polls and his retirement, since he had satisfied the constitutionally required two terms in office.
