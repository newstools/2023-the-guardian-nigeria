•Declares Obi answer to Nigeria’s woes
Nigerians have been told that only active participation and election of credible leaders in the forthcoming general elections would guarantee brighter future for the country. Labour Party (LP) senatorial candidate for Imo West, Charles Ahize, who stated this in a media parley in Owerri, yesterday, urged the electorate to eschew all forms of sentiment and rally support for LP’s presidential candidate, Peter Obi. Ahize, a renowned businessman and lawyer, said voting Obi represents hope for every category of citizens, and would help foster desired peace, justice and unity in the country. He said: “Nigeria might be doomed if Obi failed to win the presidency, because he is credible and has best ideas, as well as vision to move this country forward for general good of the people.” He further said that the level of marginalisation, which Igbo are being subjected to, under the All Progressives Congress (APC) government, is obvious and enough to compel them to change the narrative by voting out the party. He also expressed worry over the spate of insecurity in Imo State, especially in his senatorial district, stressing that the situation has forced his fellow constituents to seek refuge outside their area for safety. Ahize disclosed that part of his reasons for going to the Senate is to promote polices that would bring Igbo together for a common goal, as well as restore their confidence in governance of the country. He said: “If I am elected to the Senate, I will be a voice for not only my people of Orlu zone, but the entire Igbo nation. I will champion development for my people, and also promote polices and ideas that would unite Igbo for national progress. “Today, I am begging you journalists to eschew sentiment of any kind and join hands in making sure that Obi wins the presidency, because he is coming to turn Nigeria around for our collective good. That I can assure you.”
