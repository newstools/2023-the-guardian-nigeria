All is now set for the Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) Cage fight, tagged ‘Battle of Gladiators, billed to hold at the Muson Centre, Lagos, today. The championship, which will feature 10 entertaining international fights from 7.00 p.m., is packed by Akalaka Spirit of the Warrior Promotion. It will also feature two lady warriors, who are well versed in the MMA business. According to the organisers, at the event, 2022 National Sports Festival judo gold medalist, Terlumun Doose, will battle with Togo’s striking sensation, Cynthia Jibidar, in an all ladies’ bantamweight affair that promises intense heat, doggedness and elegance. The main event in the men’s lightweight category is a Nigeria/Ghana challenge, with      Black Panther Onem Richard battling with Accra-based Richard ‘Boyka’ Asiedu. The Ghanaian champion, Asiedu, says he is focused on correcting last March’s mistakes when he was disqualified and lost to Cornell Thompson of Nigeria at the Akalaka 1 Streetfight contest in Ahoada, Rivers State. Event promoter, Dr. Ebere Bernard, a Nigerian Army veteran and combat sports specialist, said he believes in focusing on grassroots development and local talents that can be nurtured to systematically become professional MMA fighters. “The promotion is focused on grassroots youth development, which constitutes about 70 per cent Nigerian population, with a target of grooming 200 MMA prospects every year across the country for the next five years,” he said. He said the Gladiators Cage Fight is a prelude event to one of the biggest MMA fight nights in Nigeria, tagged ‘The Night of Glamour and Glory’ coming up on April 29, 2023 in Abuja. It will be headlined by former American MMA champion, D’juan ‘Dirty South’ Owens, who will fight against a North African opponent.
