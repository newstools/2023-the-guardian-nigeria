Sports broadcasting outfit, Sportsville, has listed 16 personalities and corporate bodies for the third edition of its award, which holds on February 4 at the Lagos Country Club, Ikeja. According to the Chief Executive Officer of the outfit, Frank Ilaboya, the shortlisted awardees will soon be unveiled, adding that the 2023 award will be an elaborate ceremony with a global media audience. Ilaboya explained that the award would continue to maintain its high standard of rewarding those truly deserving of it. He said: “Just like the previous editions, this year’s winners are selected after a very painstaking scrutiny done by a panel that included leading sports editors. “Our objective remains the same, to reward and appreciate Nigerians and corporate organisations, who have contributed to the development of sports over the years.
“The Sportsville Award is unique because we do a thorough job in ensuring that only deserving sports personalities and corporate organisations are appreciated.” Last year, the award was held at the prestigious Radisson Hotels, Ikeja, with Sports Minister, Sunday Dare, leading the pack of sports personalities that were recognised and awarded at the event.
