All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate for Bauchi State, Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar (rtd), has inaugurated a Tinubu Presidential Support Group, called Lobito, to mobilise grassroots votes for the candidates of the party. Sadique said it is pertinent to elect all APC candidates to end the administration of Governor Bala Mohammed, which he said was not paying workers as and when due.  He said: “We appreciate this group’s support and, by God’s grace, we will deliver the dividends of democracy equitably and our workers will be paid at the end of every month. “It is very sad that our workers cannot get their payment. It is very sad that someone will serve a state for 35 years and he won’t be paid pension and gratuity. We will change all these by God’s grace. We will create employment for our youths and empower the women for economic prosperity.” Also, promising to boost the agricultural potential of Bauchi by assisting the farmers with inputs, training and information on improved methods, he urged the electorate to support APC candidates in the state and elect Tinubu as president. Chairman, Steering Committee, Lobito Group 4 Asiwaju, Idris Lanzai, and the Secretary, Usman Darazo, pledged to mobilise grassroots votes from where they operate from.
