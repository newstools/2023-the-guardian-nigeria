University of Lagos (UNILAG) has announced that there will not be an admission of students to two programmes for the 2023 academic session. UNILAG registrar Oladejo Azeez made the disclosure in a statement on the tertiary institution’s website. “All prospective UTME and Direct Entry candidates for the 2023 admission exercise should please note that the University of Lagos will not run two programmes, namely: Biochemistry and Petroleum & Gas Engineering. Hence, there will be no admission into the two programmes. “Candidates are hereby advised not to choose any of these two programmes, and those who have done so should change to other programmes.” UNILAG in December 2022 announced the commencement of the student admission process and cutoff marks for the 2023 academic session.
