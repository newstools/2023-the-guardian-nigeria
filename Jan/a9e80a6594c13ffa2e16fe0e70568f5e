The Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC) is set to spud the first oil well in Nassarawa State in March 2023.  Kyari added that community support and a conducive environment are key to a successful operation in the area in order to avoid the experience of the Niger Delta.
 
Sule congratulated the NNPC boss on the successful commencement of oil production and the Kolmani Integrated Development Project, which was launched in November 2022 by President Muhammadu Buhari, which he described as similar to what obtains in Saudi Arabia.
 
“I want to congratulate you, the management of NNPC and the Federal Government for what you have done at Kolmani, for those who don’t know what you have done for Nigeria, you have written your name in gold,’’ Sule stated. He commended President Muhammadu Buhari for his support while assuring the NNPC of a conducive environment.
