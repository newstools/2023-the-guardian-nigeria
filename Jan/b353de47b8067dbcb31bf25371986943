The Plateau state police command has apprehended a pastor by the name Albarka Sukuya for staging his kidnap and demanding money from members of his congregation. The state police spokesman, DSP Alfred Alabo, disclosed this in a statement on Wednesday. Alabo alleged that Sukuya conspired with his gang to fake his abduction multiple times and fraudulently collect ransom from sympathisers. ”The police has uncovered the nefarious act of one Pastor Albarka Sukuya of Jenta Apata, Jos, who on several occasions staged his kidnap with his cohorts and received ransom from sympathising members of his congregation,” Alabo said ”Sequel to his spurious kidnaps of Nov. 14 and Nov. 15, 2022, where N400,000 and N200,000, respectively, were paid by his sympathisers as a ransom for his release, the incidents triggered suspicion.” The policeman added that the clergyman has confessed to committing the crime and had also revealed the identity of the three other members of his gang. Alado added that the investigation commenced immediately and urged the public to be watchful and to report any suspicious incident to relevant security agencies for a prompt response.
