The Federal Government has accredited the Institute for Enterprise Management and Analytics (IEMA) as a Conformity Assessment Body (CAB). The accreditation issued by the Nigerian National Accreditation Service (NINAS), now authorises the institute to award ISO Certification to organisations that have met the conformity requirement for certification. Director-General of IEMA, Raymond Smith, indicated that a lot of companies in Nigeria, even though they have very good operating processes, are not able to do business with international organisations due to standard compliance challenges. He said IEMA is empowered by the Federal Government and positioned to help encourage and certify Nigerian companies that have met the rigorous criteria required for certification. He emphasised that to do good business now in Nigeria, a company must have an ISO certification, which he said is the standard. Corroborating, Smith, Chairman of the Governing Council, IEMA, Prof. Ademola Ojo, encouraged Nigerian companies to embrace standard certification and take advantage of the IEMA accreditation to certify their processes and compete efficiently within and outside Nigeria. According to him, IEMA is one of the only three organisations accredited by the Federal Government and Licensed by the Nigerian National Accreditation Service (NINAS).
