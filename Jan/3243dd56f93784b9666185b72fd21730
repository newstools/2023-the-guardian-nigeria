Seventeen days after guiding Argentina to an epic World Cup final victory over France, Lionel Messi reported back to work on Wednesday, his French club Paris Saint-Germain announced. The 35-year-old seven-time Ballon d’Or winner reported back to the club’s training ground as they prepare for Saturday’s French Cup tie at third-tier side Chateauroux. Messi scored twice as Argentina drew 3-3 with France in the Qatar final, before prevailing in the penalty shoot-out. Since then he has been celebrating in Argentina and spending time with his family. On Wednesday, he was given a guard of honour by his teammates at the training ground, before being presented with a small trophy by PSG’s sporting director Luis Campos, according to images posted by the club on its Twitter account. Messi’s teammates Kylian Mbappe, who scored a hat-trick in a losing cause in the final, and Morocco’s Achraf Hakimi returned to club duty just three days after the final with Brazil’s Neymar checking in a day later. Messi is unlikely to play this weekend, more probably making his return in the home Ligue 1 match against Angers next Wednesday.
