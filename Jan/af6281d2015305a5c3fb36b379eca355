Sports Minister, Sunday Dare, yesterday, visited ailing former Golden Eaglets coach, Sebastian Brodericks Imasuen, who is currently recovering from stroke at the University of Benin Teaching Hospital (UBTH). The minister, represented by his Special Assistant on Media, Toyin Ibitoye, also gave the 1985 FIFA U-16 World Cup winning coach an undisclosed amount of money to the coach. He described Broderick as a national hero, who needs all care he can get to bounce back to good health. The minister told the coach’s wife, Helen, that he felt compelled to help the U-17 World Cup winning coach to ensure he gets the best of treatment at the UBTH. Helen, who thanked the minister for his gesture, said her husband was responding to treatment, while calling for more support for the coach, noting she hopes that Imasuen will continue to respond to treatment “I thank the minister for this kind gesture, it shows that the plight of my husband is getting to the right channel. I pray that he would continue to receive the support he needs to get back to his feet. “He is better now compared to when we brought him to the hospital. Hopefully, he can get better and be relocated to another ward to continue treatment. I urge that he get more support as he continues his recovery,” he said.
