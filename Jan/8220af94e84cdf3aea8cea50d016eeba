Africa’s leading payments technology company, Flutterwave has said it will help more small-scale businesses in Africa with visibility at the ongoing Big Brother Titans (BB Titans). Flutterwave in December 2022 announced its collaboration with Multichoice Africa in Lekki, Lagos for the  Big Brother Titans reality TV show. BB Titans is a fusion of two of the largest reality shows in Africa– Big Brother Naija (Big Brother Nigeria) and Big Brother Mzansi (Big Brother South Africa). The show which kicked off on January 12, 2023 features housemates from Nigeria and South Africa, respectively, in one Big Brother house, vying for the Titan crown worth $100,000 in cash and other exciting prizes. This season is themed “Rise of the Giants” and is touted to promote African unity and excellence through entertainment. The show will be co-hosted by Ebuka Obi-Uchendu and Lawrence Maleka, available 24/7 to audiences in the US, UK, Republic of Ireland, and over 40 African countries, 34 of which Flutterwave is active in. Flutterwave said it planned to leverage its reach across Africa to spotlight members of its small business community to help them grow and expand their business across the continent. The spotlight campaign was earlier launched during the BBNaija Season 7, where FootCity, Avoir Jewelry, Famasi Africa, and other SMEs all received free exposure which helped them increase sales. Paul Harris, Country Manager, Flutterwave South Africa, commented, “Our collaboration with the Big Brother Titans helps us speak to our extensive reach across Africa. This show would be broadcast across 40 African countries, an opportunity to support businesses in these countries. Big Brother Titans will open up more opportunities for SMEs on Flutterwave to access a larger audience. With this sponsorship, we’re telling businesses in Africa, wherever they are, that they can start anywhere and go far.”
