Vice-Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and Governor of Delta, Ifeanyi Okowa, yesterday, said Atiku Abubakar presidency would rebuild the nation’s economy, if elected. Okowa gave the assurance at Otu-Jeremi during the party’s campaign in Ughelli South and Ethiope West councils of the state, saying the PDP knows how to revive economy, as it did in 1999 when it came into power after years of military rule. He urged the people to vote massively to cross the one million votes mark to ensure victory for the party, adding that the more the votes, the stronger his voice would be in Abuja. He said the ruling APC had destroyed Nigeria’s economy, forcing multinational companies and organisations to relocate to Ghana. Okowa said: “We did it when we came in 1999 and took the country to greater heights until APC came with its negative change that brought hunger, poverty, insecurity and unemployment. “All the problems brought into the country by the APC-led Federal Government would be addressed by the PDP presidency, when elected. “When the PDP government came on board in 1999 after long years of military rule, we restored the lost glory of the country by resuscitating the economy to an enviable status.” On the governorship election in the state, Okowa said that PDP candidate, Sheriff Oborevwori, possessed qualifications required to be governor and urged the people to support him and all other party candidates in the state.
