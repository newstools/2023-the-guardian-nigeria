Alexandre Lacazette scored a hat-trick as Lyon eased into the last 16 of the French Cup on Saturday with a 3-0 win over fifth-tier side Chambery. The 31-year-old striker netted twice in the first half and completed his first treble since August 2016 midway through the second. “We often talk about the magic of the Cup but we’re happy it didn’t work out for Chambery,” he said. It was a morale-boosting win for Lyon boss Laurent Blanc who has seen his side slip to ninth in the Ligue 1 table, 12 points outside the European places. Chambery brought on 48-year-old former Algeria international Nassim Akrour in the 63rd minute but the veteran could not inspire a comeback. On Friday, Marseille extended their winning streak to eight matches with a 1-0 victory against Rennes. Paris Saint-Germain will take on amateur sixth-tier club Pays de Cassel on Monday.
