Governorship candidate of Social Democratic Party (SDP) in Rivers State,  Magnus Abe, has said if elected governor, his administration will integrate new ways of doing things in the state. Abe said his administration would not impose leaders on the people but would allow communities to choose their leaders, who would, in turn, guide the government on what to do for the people. He stated this at Okrika while receiving some defectors from other political parties to the SDP.  Abe said: “We have talked to you about freedom, liberty and respect for norms and institutions. We will ensure we give you back the rights to choose your leaders. It is the people you choose as leaders that we will deal with. “We will not come to your community and impose people on you, who don’t have your confidence. No, we will allow you to choose your own leaders so that if something is bad for you, they will also come to you and say no, this thing is not good. My people will not like this. My people do not behave like this. People don’t like this and all that.” “That’s what leaders and communities are supposed to do for the community, guide the government so that the government will in turn serve the people. We are also going to integrate a new way of doing things in Rivers State.”
