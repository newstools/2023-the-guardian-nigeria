Ebonyi State workers, under the auspices of Trade Union Congress (TUC), yesterday, protested alleged allocation of workers’ housing estate to politicians and unidentified individuals who are not working in any government establishment in the state. Briefing journalists in Abakaliki, the State Chairman of TUC, Chidi Igboji, explained that Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (FMBN) sponsored the affordable housing delivery project, in collaboration with the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Trade Union Congress and Nigeria Employees’ Consultative Association. He alleged that the buildings have been allotted to unknown people, who are not working in any government establishment in the state by FMBN and the project developer. Igboji said members of TUC regretted the negligence of FMBN and the developer of the housing project, especially when they found that some politicians allegedly connived with the developer to displace supposed beneficiaries. He further expressed dismay over non-accommodation of TUC members in the housing allocation and allotment processes, even when an encouraging amount of money had been deducted from their bank accounts. The Guardian gathered that 90 houses of three-bedroom flats were built for government workers in the state, which were officially commissioned by the governor. TUC members, who boycotted the commissioning, appealed to Umahi and President Muhammad Buhari to stop the alleged calculated strategy by FMBN and the developer of the housing project to deny them access to the buildings, proposing to employ every legal means to reclaim their rights.
