Edo State Government, as part of efforts to curb spread of Lassa fever and ensure the health and safety of residents, has met with stakeholders in seven councils most affected by the disease in the state. Briefing journalists after the meeting in Esan West Council secretariat, Edo State Commissioner for Health, Prof. Obehi Akoria, said government has put in place mechanisms to contain the disease and protect citizens. A statement by Special Assistant to Edo State Government on Media Projects,  Crusoe Osagie, listed the councils mostly affected by the disease are Esan West, Etsako West, Esan North East, Esan Central, Etsako Central, Esan South East and Etsako East. He said: “Edo State Government, through the Ministry of Health, is stepping up efforts to contain the spread of the disease in the state and is meeting with relevant stakeholders, including traditional, religious and community leaders, Heads of Local Government Administration (HOLGA), artisans and market leaders and different groups and associations in the seven councils most affected by the disease.” Decrying the rise of Lassa fever in the state,  Obehi noted: “Lassa fever has been with us in Edo State for more than 30 years, but we have never seen what we are seeing now. In the past one week alone, we have confirmed 18 cases. This is quite alarming and demands drastic measures. Lassa fever is communicable, unlike hypertension and diabetes. As such, if one person has the disease, everybody is at risk. So, this is a state emergency situation, and we must take the bull by the horn to address the challenge.” He said Edo State Public Health Emergency Operation Centre for Lassa fever has been activated since January 5, even as the government is taking other necessary measures to curb the spread, including increased surveillance and sensitisation campaigns, among others.
