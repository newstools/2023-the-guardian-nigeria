Ahead of the February 25 general elections, Labour Party (LP) Chairman in Amuwo-Odofin Local Council, Ebele Nwuzor, has declared that George Adegeye remains the party’s House of Representatives candidate in the council. In a statement, yesterday, entitled ‘No Controversy: Adegeye is Labour Party Candidate for Amuwo-Odofin Federal Constituency’, Nwuzor noted that since Adegeye emerged as the Reps candidate, many more members had been effectively galvanised for the good of the party. He maintained that no amount of blackmail or spurious claims by Ejike Metu, who was claiming the ticket, would hinder the party’s journey to total victory in Amuwo-Odofin. Nwuzor also cited the court’s pronouncement that affirmed Adegeye as the party’s flagbearer, stressing that the party, armed by this legal pivot, would deliver its candidate at the polls next month. The statement reads: “The Court of Appeal judgment of November 18, 2022 affirmed George Adegeye as the authentic candidate of LP for Amuwo Odofin Federal Constituency in the 2023 general elections.” We were surprised to see the posters of a self-declared candidate, Ejike Metu, who we knew had earlier contested the Reps ticket in Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) before joining LP. “We appreciate Ejike’s decision to join LP, but we won’t tolerate any attempt to cause division within the party for selfish ends.”
