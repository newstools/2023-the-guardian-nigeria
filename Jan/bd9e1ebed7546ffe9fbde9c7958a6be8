The victory recorded by Bendel Insurance in the Nigeria Premier Football League (NPFL) season opener against former champions, Akwa United, has thrilled the Chairman of Edo Sports Commission, Yusuf Alli. He said the victory is a sign of many good things to come. Bendel Insurance secured a 2-0 victory at the Nest of Champions in Uyo, on Sunday, to send a signal to other teams in the abridged NPFL league of its determination to secure a continental ticket this season. Goals from Imade Osarenkhoe and Divine Nwachukwu gave the ‘Benin Arsenal’ all three points to the coach Monday Odigie-led Bendel Insurance. Speaking with The Guardian yesterday, Alli, a former African champion in the long jump, stated that the victory would encourage Edo State government to invest more on the team. “I said before the commencement of the NPFL that we have a team that is capable of getting a continental ticket this year. I know that the NPFL is a big and tough league, but the players and technical crew have won our respect. I believe Bendel Insurance is still work in progress irrespective of this big result in Uyo. “The people of Edo State are happy with their performance. I thank the state government, particularly, the Deputy Governor for his morale and financial support for the team. I have told the players and their coaches not to allow this victory get into their head. We need more wins to scale through this abridged league,” Alli stated.
