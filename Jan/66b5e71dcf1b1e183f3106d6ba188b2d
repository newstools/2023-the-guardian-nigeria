Super Falcons’ Head Coach, Randy Waldrum is optimistic of an impressive performance at the forthcoming FIFA Women’s World Cup in Australia & New Zealand. The American tactician said his team can go far in the global tournament, but insists they have to take it one step at a time.
“The first target for us at the World Cup is to advance out of the group stage,” Waldrum said. “Everyone wants to get to the knockout stage, but obviously in order to achieve that, you have to get out of the group, and our focus is principally on doing that.” The Super Falcons survived a huge scare at the 12th Women Africa Cup of Nations in Morocco, where they finished in fourth place. The team lost to eventual champions, South Africa in the opening match, and then lost to the host nation, Morocco, via penalty shootout in the semi finals. The Falcons failed to overcome the setback as they eventually lost to Zambia in the third-place match by a lone goal. Nigeria will tackle Olympic champions, Canada, co-hosts Australia and Republic of Ireland in the group stage at the FIFA Women’s World Cup that will begin on July 20.
The Falcons will begin in Brisbane, where they will play two of their three matches, with the other game in another Australian city, Melbourne. Nigeria is in the elite group of only seven countries that have never failed to qualify for the FIFA Women’s World Cup since the competition was launched in China 32 years ago.
