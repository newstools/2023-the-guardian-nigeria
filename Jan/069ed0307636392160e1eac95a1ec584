• Noted Atiku, Tinubu should step down
• Hold me responsible if Obi fails, says party chieftain Special Adviser to Labour Party’s presidential candidate, Peter Obi, on Technology and Strategic Alliances, Valentine Ozigbo, has debunked reports that key officials of the party’s Presidential Campaign Council met in Abuja, on Monday, to discuss moves aimed at aligning with the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, in the upcoming presidential election. In a statement issued, yesterday, the former PDP Anambra governorship candidate in 2021 described the story as false, and is aimed at derailing the massive momentum of Obidients across Nigeria and the world, who are rooting for Obi’s presidency. Ozigbo said: “The claims reported on a faceless online medium are completely false and baseless. The Labour Party is committed to supporting its presidential candidate and his vision for leading Nigeria out of its current travails.
“We firmly believe Obi is the best candidate for the presidency, considering his track record of solid leadership, as well as a clear plan to address challenges facing our country.
“He has consistently demonstrated deep understanding of the needs of the Nigerians and has the experience, as well as expertise needed to implement effective policies, which would bring about real change.
“It is disappointing that some elements within the PDP are spreading false rumours, and engaging in underhanded tactics rather than focusing on a fair and open contest of ideas. This unprofessional conduct indicates their fear of fair competition and lack of confidence in their own candidate’s abilities.” On the likelihood of any candidate stepping down for the other, Ozigbo said he believes that for Nigeria to have a clean break from its ugly past, those alleged to be culpable in undermining Nigeria’s progress and the prosperity of our people may consider it needful to step aside for Obi in the best interest of Nigeria’s future. Meanwhile, a retired army chief, Col. Chinyere Obi, has asked Nigerians to hold her accountable if Peter Obi failed to deliver on his seven points agenda within one year in office if elected. Col. Obi, who served as National Coordinator for Atiku House to House Support Group in 2019, said her decision to declare support for the Labour Party presidential candidate is based on his precedence and credibility in leadership. Speaking to newsmen in Owerri, yesterday, the retired army chief stated that among the presidential candidates, Obi remains a candidate to trust, and can salvage the country from its current woes if elected. According her, Nigerians especially the youths should rise up and fight against injustice, insecurity, economic stagnation and other challenges in the country by not electing bad and incompetent leaders in the forthcoming general elections.
