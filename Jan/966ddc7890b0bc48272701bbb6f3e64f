Thousands of commuters were stranded, and chaos broke out in Osun State, yesterday, as the protest, which erupted in the state following the verdict of the Governorship Election Petition Tribunal reignited.  They called on President Muhammadu Buhari and the international community to step in and ensure that such a judgment did not stand.
“This type of judgment is dangerous to our democracy. It means that our votes will not count and justice cannot be served. We call on President Muhammadu Buhari, the United Nations, and other members of the international community to step in. Such a judgment must not stand,” one of the protesters said. Some residents of Iwo and loyalists of Governor Oyetola held a demonstration in celebration of the tribunal’s victory.
 
Governor Adeleke, in a statewide address, on Friday, informed the people of the state that his counsels have filed an appeal against the tribunal’s judgment and that they had also written to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) intimating of the appeal, and seeking non-implementation of the judgment until the determination of the appeal.
