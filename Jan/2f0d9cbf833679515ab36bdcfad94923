Roma coach Jose Mourinho compares Victor Osimhen to Didier Drogba and admits he would ‘buy him if I was at a club with a lot of money,’ but also had a stern warning for the Napoli striker about Premier League life, reports football-italia.net. The Nigeria international extended his lead in the Capocannoniere charts with the 14th Serie A goal of the season and it was a stunner too, as he controlled Kvicha Kvaratskhelia’s cross with his chest, then juggled it on his right thigh before smashing in the right-foot volley. Speaking at a press conference after Roma’s 2-1 defeat at the Stadio Maradona, Mourinho was asked about Osimhen in comparison with a player he worked with at Chelsea, the legend Drogba. “He is of the same level as Drogba, but Didier didn’t dive,” replied Mou. “If Victor changes, then okay. I’d buy him if I was at a club with a lot of money. However, if he does go to England one day, he needs to change, because in Italy they put up with this sort of behaviour, whereas in the Premier League, they’d come down hard on him.” The Special One also spoke to Osimhen after the match. “I told him that he scored a wonderful goal and needs to stop diving so much. His goal was fantastic, he did the same thing when we met earlier this season, so he’s a fantastic player. But he mustn’t dive.”
