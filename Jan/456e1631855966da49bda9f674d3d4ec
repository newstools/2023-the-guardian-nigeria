Speaking with The Guardian in Benin City, Edo State during the unveiling of new set of jersey for both Bendel Insurance and Edo Queens, Elegbeleye said that the IMC would deplore all right mechanism to put the league in good shape. “We are out to do things different from what we used to have in the past,” he said. “I know that it is a great task to correct some of the things we have noticed in the league, but with the cooperation of Nigerians, we will achieve it.” Meanwhile, home matches involving the three NPFL clubs based in the Southeast will kick off at 3.00 p.m. on Sundays, the IMC has revealed. In a statement, yesterday, IMC directed NPFL clubs to note the fixture adjustments and comply. The IMC also announced the lifting of the ban on Shooting Stars Sports Club (3SC), playing with fans in attendance at the Lekan Salami Stadium, Ibadan. 3SC fans were banned from attending matches last season following repeated violent incidents occasioning attacks on match officials and club players and officials at the stadium.
