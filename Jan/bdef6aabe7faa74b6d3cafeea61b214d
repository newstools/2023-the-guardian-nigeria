Three people were killed and at least two others wounded following a Russian strike on the city of Konstantynivka in eastern Ukraine, the local governor said on Saturday. “The Russians fired at a residential neighbourhood, damaged four multi-storey buildings, a hotel, garages and civilian cars,” Donetsk regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said on social media. “Three civilians were killed. At least two were wounded,” he added. Kyrylenko said rescue workers and police were at the scene, “helping people and carefully documenting yet another crime by the Russian occupiers on our land”. Images posted on Kyrylenko’s Telegram account showed apartment buildings with blown-out windows and debris scattered around the charred remains of a car. Almost a year into its invasion of Ukraine, Russia is seeking to seize control of the entire Donetsk region, which it has already declared a part of Russia. Ukraine said this week that Russian troops had stepped up their attacks in the east, particularly on the towns of Vugledar and Bakhmut. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Friday the situation on the front was “extremely acute”, particularly in the Donetsk region.
