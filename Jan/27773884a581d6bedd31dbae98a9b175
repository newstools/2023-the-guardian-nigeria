It is a new dawn for Professional Golfers Association of Nigeria (PGAN), whose members have been given reasons to enter 2023 with renewed hope. Over the weekend, the new PGAN executive disclosed that they are setting out their tenure with a championship, which will feature over 200 professional and amateur players. As part of the new deal, professional players will battle for a N20 million in prize monies. According to PGAN’s Executive Director, Tony Philmore, who is also a professional golfer, for one week, the pros will feature in a tournament sponsored by the body and aided by some corporate bodies. “We are celebrating ourselves,” Philmore said, adding, “in as much as we would gladly welcome any sponsorship to add glamour to this event, we will, however, move ahead and pay from our purse in a situation where no sponsor shows. This is already a task that must be accomplished.” Explaining the modalities for the tournament, PGAN Media Director, Susan Cokekotas, said the event, which is slated to begin on Wednesday and run through Saturday at the Port Harcourt Club 1928 Golf Section, will be an icing on the new board’s cake, which, she said, has accomplished so much within its short period in power. She disclosed that part of activities lined up during the championship is an investiture on two of golf’s major sponsors, Chief Ikenna Okafor and Dr. Austin Ndubuisi.
