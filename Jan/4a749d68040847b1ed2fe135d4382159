The Chief Press Secretary (CPS) to the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Mr. Rotimi Oyekanmi, has said that the total number of uncollected Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) nationwide would be announced by the electoral empire after the deadline for collection of PVCs, just before the 2023 general election.  Therefore, we cannot give an accurate number of uncollected PVCs nationwide now because people are still collecting them every day.
