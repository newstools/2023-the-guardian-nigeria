The Department of State Services (DSS) has intercepted some members of organised syndicates involved in selling the newly redesigned naira notes. DSS spokesperson, Peter Afunanya, disclosed this in a statement on Monday. Afunanya said the DSS in the course of its operations in parts of the country established that some commercial bank officials were aiding the economic malfeasance. “Consequently, the Service warns the currency racketeers to desist from this ignoble act. Appropriate regulatory authorities are, in this same vein, urged to step up monitoring and supervisory activities to address emerging trends expeditiously. “It should be noted that the Service has ordered its Commands and Formations to further ensure that all persons and groups engaged in the illegal sale of the notes are identified. “Therefore, anyone with useful information relating to this is encouraged to pass the same to the relevant authorities”, Afunanya said. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) had on Sunday extended the deadline for the swapping of old naira notes with the redesigned ones till February 10, 2023 following pressure from a different quarter. The apex bank added, “a 10-day extension of the deadline from January 31, 2023, to February 10, 2023, to allow for the collection of more old notes.”
