The Speaker of Plateau State House of Assembly Yakubu Sanda, yesterday, survived a kidnap attempt.
Sanda was rescued by the combined forces of police personnel attached to the speaker and the Divisional Police Office in the area. In a statement, the command’s Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Alfred Alabo, said: “The Plateau State Police Command, in its aggressive fight against crime and criminality has continued to frustrate the evil and dastardly act of men of the underworld through the effective and pro-active crime prevention strategies put in place by the chief crime buster in the state, CP Bartholomew Onyeka”
 
The statement further said that the brilliant strategy designed by the commissioner of police have yielded enormous and laudable operational successes in recent times. He stated that the strategy assisted greatly in foiling the kidnap of the speaker. “On January 6, 2023 at about 11:20pm while the speaker arrived his residence at Federal Low Cost Housing, Jos South, it was noticed that three unidentified gunmen operating in an ash CR-V Jeep had trailed the speaker to his residence and attempted to enter his house with the intent to kidnap him but their mission was made impossible by the intrepid police on duty. “This was coupled by the timely response of the Divisional Police Officers (DPO), SP Ayuba and his men who joined forces with the men on guard to repelled the evil act,” it added. The statement added that the command is making concerted efforts to track down and arrest the fleeing suspects.
