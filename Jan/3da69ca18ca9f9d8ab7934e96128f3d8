A legal practitioner, Chukwuma-Machukwu Ume, has urged Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State to investigate the allegation levelled against a businesswoman, Uju Kennedy-Ohanenye, over the demolition of a paint factory in the state. Ume, in a petition addressed to the governor through his law firm, said the demolition of the factory, Legacy Paints Ltd, was allegedly orchestrated by Kennedy-Ohanenye. The lawyer said that his client lawfully owns the N1.3 billion ultramodern paint factory located at Plot M4, Cattle Lairage Site, Emene, Enugu State.
He said: “The Enugu State government, through the state’s Ministry of Lands, in 2013, validly granted Statutory Certificate of Occupancy No: CAL/07566, dated November 25, 2013, and registered as NO: 5, Vol. 126, Land Registry, Enugu, for 99 years, to Dezern Nigeria Ltd in respect of a commercial piece of land known and situated at Plot M4, Cattle Lairage Site, Emene, Enugu State. “It is also in the record of your state government that this company duly applied and got necessary factory buildings approval. “As a follow-up, they, in line with the state government’s policy of encouraging indigenous industrialisation of the state, immediately constructed and established an ultra-modern paint manufacturing factory at a cost of N1 billion.” Ume said despite the pendency of the matter in court, Kennedy-Ohanenye, allegedly masterminded its demolition on December 22, 2022.
