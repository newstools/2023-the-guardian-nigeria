Founder of DAAR Communication Raymond Dokpesi has been released by police in the United Kingdom on Monday. Dokpesi, a chieftain of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), is the founder of African Independent Television (AIT) and Raypower FM. He is the deputy director-general, technical and systems of the PDP Presidential Campaign Council. Multiple media reports late Sunday said Dokpesi was arrested in London. Dokpesi was reportedly picked up at London Heathrow Airport as he touched down from a connecting flight via Frankfurt on Sunday evening ahead of a meeting with PDP presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar. DAAR Communications, however, disclosed that Dokpesi has been released. “Dokpesi arrived via Frankfurt from Abuja on a Lufthansa airlines flight and was invited off the plane, before other passengers were disembarked,” DAAR Communications said in a statement. “Dokpesi was delayed at the airport for some hours before his passport was stamped and he was cleared by British Immigration officials for entry into the country.” It did not disclose the reason for the incident but explained that Dokpesi’s visit to the UK is connected to an invitation by the UK government to Atiku “to share perspectives on issues around the 2023 presidential elections.” “Chief Dokpesi wishes to thank all for their outpour of love, prayers and support following the news of the incident and to reassure that he is hale and hearty,” it said.
