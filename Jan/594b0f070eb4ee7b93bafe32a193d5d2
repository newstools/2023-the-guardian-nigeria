• Court fixes February 13 for adoption of written addresses in trial within trial The trial of Chidinma Ojukwu, the alleged killer of Chief Executive Officer of Super TV, Usifo Ataga, could not continue, yesterday, due to the prosecution’s inability to respond to her written address. The defendant, an undergraduate student of the University of Lagos, is standing trial before a Lagos State High Court, for alleged murder of Ataga. She is also charged with stealing and forgery alongside her sister, Chioma Egbuchu, and one Adedapo Quadri. The court had on November 17, 2022, adjourned till January 11, 2023 for adoption of written addresses in a trial-within-trial it conducted to ascertain if the statement of the defendant at a police station was made voluntarily.
 
The defendant had told the court that she was slapped and forced to sign statements written by the police. Ojukwu said so while testifying in the trial-within-trial.
 
The defendant said during her defence that ASP Olusegun Bamidele and Olufunke Madeyinlo told her to sign statements against her will. She also said that Bamidele told her to narrate his own written statement to the commissioner of police after tearing her statement.
