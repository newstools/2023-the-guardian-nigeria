Evangelist Allays Fears On Violence After 2023 Elections
THE Emeritus Archbishop and Dean, Church of Nigeria, Anglican Communion, Maxwell Anikwenwa has asked eligible voters to collect their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) to enable them participate in the 2023 general elections.  On Nigerians leaving the country in search of greener pastures, he said: “The earth and its fullness thereof belongs to God. Sons and daughters of God are free to move anywhere. We have other nationalities like Indians, Americans and Chinese in Nigeria. The world belongs to all of us.”
 
He disclosed that the church is holding its annual Genesis Team Annual Crusade on January 13, 2023, at Rehoboth Prayer Mountain, Ilaro Road, Ogun State.
 
With the theme: “And the Lord appeared unto him,” he revealed that The Ekunola Davies Ministry is the first indigenous ministry of the Celestial Church of Christ that focused on revival, teachings, and deliverance.
 
He added that it is a ministry that started in Oshodi, Lagos State in 2001 before relocating to its prayer mountain in Ilaro, Ogun State.
