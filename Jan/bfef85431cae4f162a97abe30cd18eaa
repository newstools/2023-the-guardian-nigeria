Designed to fuel the vision of a more personalised travel experience, Delta Airline, has introduced fast, free Wi-Fi for all, in partnership with T-Mobile.
  
This experience is billed to commence on February 1, 2023 to all customers on board mostly domestic mainline flights with full availability on international and regional aircraft by the end of 2024.
  
The airline will offer the service on more than 700 Viasat-equipped aircraft by the end of 2023. Delta also announced plans to bring free Wi-Fi on international and regional aircraft by the end of 2024.  “We didn’t just want free Wi-Fi to offer base-level service, we wanted it to be transformative for the entire onboard experience. It is imperative that all customers onboard can enjoy their favourite content just as they would at home, and we’ve put this system through meticulous tests to make that possible.”
  
Also remarking, T-Mobile CEO, Mike Sievert, said: “We believe staying connected while traveling should be an easy, seamless experience. T-Mobile customers already get free in-flight Wi-Fi and now we’re partnering with Delta to bring that experience to all customers regardless of their wireless provider so that anyone flying Delta can enjoy online access from takeoff to touchdown.” Meanwhile, Delta also announced its plans for Delta Sync Exclusives hub, a new SkyMiles-unlocked mobile platform aimed at elevating the in-flight connectivity experience with exclusive offers, access and entertainment from beloved brands that are mainstays of everyday life.
