The play directed and produced by Nigeria’s ‘Queen of Theatre’ Bolanle Austen Peters; was a perfect blend of costuming and storytelling with the cast members including actors like Francis Onwochei, Bamike Olawunmi-Adenibuyan and Uzo Osimkpa. In the stage play, she acts and sings as ‘YOUNG HASSANA’, a Fulani girl who must navigate forbidden love amidst the political and social turmoil of 1957 Nigeria. Set in Modern Day Nigeria but making many references to the past, Motherland is a fast-paced, educational and emotional look into Nigeria’s history and the country’s current state. As she has long demonstrated in her film roles, Temi is a marvellously physical actor. She outdoes herself here, showing dexterity and versatility with her singing and acting. Nigerian-born and educated in the UK, TEMI has established herself as Nigeria’s newest acting ingénue. In the last few years, she has made waves with her acting projects including the Netflix Original movie ‘CITATION’ and the Amazon Prime Original ‘THE MAN FOR THE JOB’ which has positioned her as a formidable talent to watch.
