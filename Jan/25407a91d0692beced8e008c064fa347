Three years after SBT, power supply stagnates at 3,500MW Stakeholders and electricity consumers have described as rip-off, the new increase in electricity tariff being implemented across the country by distribution companies (DisCos), despite worsening state of electricity supply in the country.  Elatuyi, who said he has been concerned about the tariff components, noted that end user tariffs reflect the costs of the entire value chain. “Generation tariff is determined using a benchmark Long Run Marginal Cost (LRMC) of the most economically efficient new entrant. In NESI, the most efficient new entrant is an expensive OCGT plant with a thermal efficiency of barely 40 per cent. This has a bearing on overall system cost.”
  
Renowned energy economist, Prof. Wunmi Iledare, noted that while it is understandable that tariffs must be appropriate to guarantee adequate return on investments into the power sector, investors must not have a buy and sell business mentality.  
  
“Power sector investment is long-term driven. The basis for tariff review must be to reward capacity delivery based on risked investments.
