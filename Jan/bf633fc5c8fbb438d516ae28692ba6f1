Nigerian flag carrier, Air Peace, has hit the 55 million passenger traffic mark, a milestone in its eight years of operations. The Guardian learnt that as of yesterday, the airline has airlifted 55,821,258 passengers nationwide and internationally. Chief Operating Officer of the airline, Oluwatoyin Olajide, said the traffic mark was a giant stride and a testament to the steady growth trajectory of the airline. According to the airline’s factsheet, Air Peace recorded a passenger load of 52,859 in its launch year, 2014, and the number increased to eight million in 2019, adding that in December 2022, the airline airlifted 14,103,018 passengers. Olajide said: “When we launched in 2014 with a record fleet of seven aircraft, we had a future-proof blueprint, driven by the vision to reduce the air travel burden of Nigerians through the provision of safe and world-class flight services. “To achieve this, we strategically invested in the right kind of aircraft, factoring business sustainability and customer experience while also hiring and training the best technical manpower to drive the process. “Now, we have 38 aircraft and are still expecting eight brand new Embraer 195-E2s from our firm order in 2019 and additional 15 brand new Boeing 737 Max 8 and 10 Order,  as we ramp up plans to strengthen our operations to serve our esteemed customers better. We are also expecting some of our aircraft undergoing maintenance overseas and by the second quarter this year, they will start returning. “We are extremely grateful to our customers and other critical stakeholders for their support and urge them to keep supporting Air Peace. We promise to further inter-connect more cities across Nigeria and beyond and improve in our service delivery,” Olajide said. She added that the airline is planning to launch London, Israel, India, Congo Kinshasa, Togo and Malabo this year, adding that more frequencies would be added to Accra, Monrovia, Freetown, Banjul and Dakar routes with more connections introduced locally. Air Peace leads Nigeria’s aviation industry with a network of 20 domestic routes, seven regional routes and three international destinations, with an increasing, mixed modern fleet comprising Boeing 777,  Boeing 737, Embraer 195-E2, Airbus 320, ERJ 145 and Dornier 328 Jet.
