Erstwhile President of All Nigerian American Congress (ANAC), Chief Amina Temitope Ajayi, has warned against violence during the forthcoming general elections. She urged the different political parties, their candidates and supporters to eschew thuggery, and electoral fraud. Ajayi, who spoke after her installation as Iya Adini of JAMSAN in Lagos, urged religious harmony. She charged youths to avoid being used as thugs by the political class, adding that they should discharge their civic and electoral responsibilities according to the law. Ajayi also urged women to be united and work for their political growth.  She pointed out that women have played significant roles in national development and nation-building, so, they should not undermine their importance in national growth. The ANAC ex-chief urged females to participate actively in the political process.  Her words: “I am so happy. I am so blessed. This is not the making of a human being. It is from the divine. It is from Almighty Allah.” It is from Almighty God. It shows that we are all one. It shows that religion should not separate us. I am advocating for national unity. Religion should unite us. We should pray together. A nation that prays together, stays together. That is why they said ‘the cry of the faithful availeth much’. Faithful are those who worship God. “I am against religious violence. I am a mother. It makes me cry. Why should they kill my people under the pretence of religion? Why? In America, nobody talks about religion. In China, nobody talks about religion. We need to change our orientation. Nigerians, we are all one. “Everybody has the right to their own political candidates. There is no do or die. But I know the Almighty God will grant us the next candidate. There is no democracy without opposition. In America, we have three parties – the Democrats, Republicans and Green Party. So, there is no big deal in we having the Obidients, Atikulates, Batifieds, Kwaknwanso and Sowores.”
