He has lots of international experience and leadership qualities.” Blind, who helped the Netherlands reach the 2022 FIFA World Cup quarter-finals in Qatar, won seven titles with Ajax, making 333 appearances, scoring 13 goals and contributing 21 assists. He also won the 2017 Europa League during his spell with Premier League club Manchester United.
