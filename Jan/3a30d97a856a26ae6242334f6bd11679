Heirs Life Assurance (HLA) has opened 11 additional retail offices nationwide to drive insurance uptake among Nigerians. Speaking on the development at the weekend, the Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Heirs Life Assurance, Niyi Onifade, said the decision is a deliberate effort to take insurance closer to the uninsured and contribute to increasing the percentage of insured individuals in the country. He said: “The decision to expand our physical presence across Nigeria was driven by the company’s strategic goal to make insurance available and accessible to all and sundry. “These cities present a vast economic opportunity for intended customers and the underwriter wants to be there for them to provide the necessary financial security they need as they live and work.” Since its launch into the insurance sector in June 2021, Heirs Life has continued to provide simple, quick, accessible and reliable life insurance, retirement and children’s education protection plans.
