Doja-Cat-Goes-Red-for-Haute-Couture-Fashion-Week-Show- At Haute Couture Week, Doja Cat was covered in red paint and 30,000 crystals For the Schiaparelli Haute Couture show in Paris, American singer Doja Cat stunned in a barely recognisable head-to-toe outfit decorated with crimson red body paint and 30,000 blood-red Swarovski crystals. The Swarovski crystals were applied by hand to the “Say So” singer’s body as well as the body paint. Doja donned a red silk bustier, a heavily beaded tulip skirt, and a pair of matching red knee-high boots to grace the Schiaparelli Spring-Summer 2023 couture show. Doja’s eye-catching outfit was custom designed by creative director Daniel Roseberry and brought to life by makeup artist Pat McGrath, whose team took five hours to finish the look. Schiaparelli’s Couture Spring-Summer 2023 show, the first of the biennial Haute Couture Week in Paris, got off to a breath-taking start when Cat arrived at the Petit Palais in Paris. McGrath described the look as “Doja’s Inferno.” He said “Collaborating with the incomparably talented Doja Cat and Daniel Roseberry was an absolute pleasure,” McGrath said. “Her patience and dedication as she sat with Team Pat McGrath and I for four hours and 58 minutes to achieve the creation, covered in over 30,000 hand-applied Swarovski crystals, was truly inspiring.” “The final product was a magical, mesmerizing masterpiece and a tribute to Doja Cat’s hard work and dedication.” DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES – JANUARY 21: Beyoncé performs on stage headlining the Grand Reveal of Dubai’s newest luxury hotel, Atlantis The Royal on January 21, 2023 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

The singer exuded glamor in a gorgeous, sequinned gown on the red carpet and later changed into a corseted yellow floor-length outfit. The concert, which marked the comeback of the singer on stage after her last performance in 2018, was attended by several A-list celebrities, including Jay-Z, her husband, Kendall Jenner, Michelle Keegan, and Mark Wright. According to The Sun media outlet, “Guests were offered hair and make-up before the gig and given a VIP gold bracelet for access instead of a bog-standard wristband.” “It was the hottest ticket in the country, perhaps the world,” the source added. “It was an intimate, personal set, with a beautiful gold sun backdrop and dancers in red.” “It’s a hint of what’s to come with Beyonce’s upcoming tour,” the outlet shared. The concert, which lasted for one hour and 15 minutes, reportedly made the singer earn £266k a minute.

Tems Makes History as First Nigerian Artist to Get Oscar Nomination Nigerian singer,Temilade Openiyi, popularly known by her stage name, Tems, has earned an Oscar nomination in the category of “Best Original Song.” The song titled “Lift Me Up,” which served as the lead single from the soundtrack album of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, was written by Tems and Ludwig Göransson, with additional writing from Rihanna and Ryan Coogler. Tems mentioned that she drew inspiration for the song from people who were once in her life, but had passed away. “After speaking with Ryan and hearing his direction for the film and the song, I wanted to write something that portrays a warm embrace from all the people that I’ve lost in my life. “I tried to imagine what it would feel like if I could sing to them now and express how much I miss them,” Tems said. “Rihanna has been an inspiration to me, so hearing her convey this song is a great honour.” The singer made history and became the first Nigerian artist to be nominated for an Oscar, and the winners will be honoured at the ceremony in Los Angeles on the 12th of March. Also nominated for the same category is “Hold My Hand,” written by Lady Gaga, the lead single from the soundtrack for the film Top Gun: Maverick.
