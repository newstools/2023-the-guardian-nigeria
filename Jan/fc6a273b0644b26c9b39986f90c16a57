Mubarak Ganiyu and Seun Ogunsakin are Nigeria’s leading youngsters to the African Junior Tennis Championship, which serves off today in Lome, Togo.  The duo, who have arrived in Togo, will be playing in the Boys U-16 category alongside Yahaya Sani. The Nigerian youngsters will fly the country’s flag when they face off with their counterparts from other parts of the continent as hostilities begin today. Nene Yakubu and Etoro Bassey are representing Nigeria in the Girls U-16 category. In the Boys U-14, Nathaniel Aluko and David Edwards will be the Nigerian representatives, while Ndidi Osaji, Khadijat Mohammed and Bright Emmanuel will try to wreak havoc against their opponents and take the title in Togo. Veteran tennis coach, Rotimi Akinloye, who is in Togo with the players, is expected to lead the players to success in the competition, as Nigeria seeks to reassert her dominance in age grade competitions. The tournament is billed to run from January 7 to 15 in Lome, where the champions in both the male and female events will be crowned. The Nigerian contingent has promised to do the country proud and restore its glory in the sport as they seek a title sweep across all categories in the weeklong competition.
