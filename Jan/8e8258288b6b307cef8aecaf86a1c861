Leaders and elders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ughelli South Local Government Area of Delta State have assured Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, the governorship candidate of the party, of massive votes by the Ughiewven nation during the March 11, 2023 gubernatorial election. At a meeting hosted by Olorogun Ima Niboro, the Director, Communications and Media Strategy of the Delta APC Campaign Council on Sunday, the leaders and elders of the party took far reaching decisions to prepare for massive mobilization of party faithful and indigenes of Ughievwen for the campaign rally scheduled for Tuesday, January 11, 2023. Welcoming the leaders and elders of the APC in Ughelli South, Olorogun Ima Niboro, who is also a member of the APC’s Presidential Campaign Council, charged all members of the party in Ughelli South to rise to the occasion and give Omo-Agege a rousing welcome at the campaign rally, and then go ahead to vote massively for the party in the February 25 presidential election and the March 11 governorship polls. The leaders and elders made individual financial donations to pool resources for the task ahead. Chief Eunice Okoh, a former chieftain of the PDP who recently dumped the PDP was also present at the meeting. She said she was tired of the PDP and has pitched her tent with the APC, promising to help row the boat of APC safely to shore. “I believe in work and eat”, she said, saying she would ensure equity in distribution of dividends of democracy at the end of the day. In an interview, Olorogun Adelabu Bodjor said the ultimate goal of the meeting was to ensure that the APC defeats the PDP hands down at the polls. Also speaking, former House of Representatives member, Dr. Chris Oghenechowen, told reporters that the 2023 election has already been won, given the rousing support the APC has received in the state. He therefore urged all members of the party to come out en masse to support Senator Omo-Agege in the rally, and in the forthcoming polls.
