Teenage sensation, Ohunene Comfort Yakubu, won dual titles in the U-16 singles and doubles events at the African Junior Tennis Championship held in Togo. In the semi final pairing, Yakubu clashed against the tournament’s number two seed, Tracy Ampah, whom she eventually prevailed over in 6-7, 6-3, 7-5, and grabbed a spot to battle for the title. In the final clash, the 14-year-old Nigerian dismissed Togolese Gnarou Anne-Marie 6-0, 6-0 to eventually secure the title in the U-16 girls’ event. Again, in the final of the U-16 girls’ doubles event, Yakubu paired with her compatriot, Etoro Bassey to beat the pair of Ghanaian Tomegah Sisu-Makena and Tracy Ampah, in two straight sets of 6-1, 6-2 to win the title. Yakubu’s performance at the African Junior Tennis Championship now makes her the first Nigerian player to win double titles in the U-16 singles and doubles events. The tennis protégé’s recent feat means that her preparation and hard work over the years is eventually paying off, as she continues to improve on her game.
