The album entitled, ‘Homework’, comprises Afro-beat and Afro-Soul genres of music that discuss various impactful topics ranging from issues of societal values to politics packaged in melodic groovy vocals. The 15-year-old groovy Nigerian- American, who is a Senior Secondary School student in Abuja, Nigeria, keeps an exceptional performance in both academic and Stage performances. Mogaji, who displayed a lot of charisma and finesse during the concert, intends to distinguish himself in the Nigerian music Industry with unique songs that will keep audiences across ages spellbound to listen to his music. “It is a lot of hard work and then sacrifice. In the next five years, I see myself at the O2 Arena Stage. I see a Wizkid, Burna-Boy Ashake, Rhema. I will distinguish myself with quality music in a way that all spheres of people can listen to, watch and enjoy my music. I love singing and writing but I love to sing more. I play football really well. I game. I love coding, I will advise young people who want to be like me to stay off drugs and have God in mind because only God can crown your efforts with success”, he added. Mr Bola Mogaji, Chief Executive Officer, Hastag Entertainment and Trybe Vybes Manager, who doubles as his father, said the concert was a visual document to showcase Tyler’s talent. “I intend to present top record labels and global distribution companies who may be interested in partnering with us on the Tyler Vybe journey.” “At 15 , the Afro-Pop and Afro-Soul genres of music have found a new exceptional talent in Tyler Vybe. You needed to have been at his sell-out concert in Abuja. “It was a night to behold, full of new amazing music, energy, stage presence and great connections with the fans”, he added. Born in the United States of America to a Yoruba father and an Igbo mother, the young artist only moved to Nigeria when he was seven years of age.
