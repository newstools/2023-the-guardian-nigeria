Lagos State All Progressives Congress (APC), yesterday, debunked the rumour that the party is in crisis ahead of the 2023 general election, describing it as imaginary by faceless people.
   
The party maintained that it is focused and ready to silence its opposition.
   
The state party’s spokesperson, Seye Oladejo, in a statement, said that the party’s reaction was to ignore the needless distraction, coming at the peak of the electioneering campaign, but had a change of mind to prevent people from accepting the fiction as reality.  There is no doubt that his style of leadership complements the landmark achievements of the state governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu to ensure a seamless campaign that will guarantee our victory.
 
“Since his assumption of office, he has assiduously ensured that the party is not factionalised by promoting fair play and justice at all times.
 
“Despite the short notice, the Lagos Presidential rally at the Teslim Balogun Stadium, Surulere, has been widely acknowledged as one of the best in terms of organisation, mobilisation, media coverage, and security arrangements.”
