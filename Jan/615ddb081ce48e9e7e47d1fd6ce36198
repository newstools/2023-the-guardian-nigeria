All Progressives Congress (APC) chief in Rivers State, Eze Chukwuemeka Eze, has accused Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) of listing hotels belonging to Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) members as Registration Area Centres (RAC) in Port Harcourt.                     
 
Eze said the choice of the hotels for the storage of sensitive materials and collation of unit results in the 2023 General Elections was a clear way of rigging the elections. In a statement made available to newsmen in Port Harcourt, the APC chief claimed the list of Registration Area Collation Centers (RACC) and RAC for Port Harcourt City Council released by INEC reveals that “Landmark Hotels, owned by Senator Olaka Nwogu, a former federal lawmaker and ally of Wike and Visa Karena Hotel, owned by Chidi Awuse, another PDP stalwart and Wike’s henchman, would featured as RAC for Orominieke and Oroworukwo communities. “Others are White Palace Hotel, Bebec Hotel, Hotel Dance, Comfort Hotel, White House Hotel, Maas Central Hotel, Danny T. Hotel, Orange Sea Hotel, Stanza Guest House, Thaland Place, Mainland Hotel, Ilo Garden Hotel, Mina Hotel, Otunkwe Guest House and Rachael Hotel. “The ownership or management of the listed hotels are directly or indirectly linked to the PDP and Wike; therefore, shortlisting them as RAC for the purpose of the 2023 elections will undermine the status of INEC  as an unbiased umpire and jeopardise the commission’s reputation built over the years,” he said. Eze called on INEC to withdraw its approval of properties owned by members of the PDP for use as RAC and revert to the use of public schools or community halls as it is the case in other local government areas. Eze expressed hope that INEC and its officials would remain neutral in the discharge of the commission’s responsibilities, reminding the officers of the commission that INEC is at the glare of the world and should be courageous to do the right thing at all times and provide a level-playing ground, secure the commission’s image and protect Nigeria’s  democracy.
