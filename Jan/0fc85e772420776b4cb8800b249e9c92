Edo State Government has restated Governor Godwin Obaseki administration’s commitment to solving pension issues in the state and called for patience among pensioners as the government tackles challenges. In a statement, Special Adviser to the Governor on Media Projects, Crusoe Osagie, noted that the government has shown good faith by solving two out of the three major issues affecting pensioners in the state. “It is instructive to note that when the Obaseki administration came into office in 2016, pension-related challenges were three-pronged. They include unpaid pension arrears running into over N4 billion; failure to harmonise pension payment and the issue of outstanding gratuities owed pensioners. “These issues date back to 2010 and the government at that time failed to address the challenges, leading to accumulation of a backlog of pension arrears and gratuities. It is necessary to emphasise that these problems predate the current administration.” “Of these three major challenges that pensioners in Edo State faced, the Obaseki government took bold step to successfully address two and is working hard at solving the last of them, which is clearing outstanding gratuities.” According to him, government has cleared arrears and ensured implementation of the Contributory Pension Scheme to avoid a repeat of the ugly experience and has also harmonised pension payment, which had lingered for over 20 years. “We urge pensioners in the state to be patient and show good faith as government’s commitment to their welfare has never been in doubt.”
