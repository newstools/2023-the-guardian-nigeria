Deeper Life Bible Church is set for the Global Crusade scheduled to hold at The Cenotaph in Asaba, Delta State with Pastor Williams Kumuyi between January 26 and 31. Delta North Overseer of the church, Pastor Godwin Osabuohien, and his Delta South counterpart, Pastor Pious Idume, made this known in Asaba while addressing church members, who matched through Nnebisi Road to sensitise the people about the crusade. The pastors, who addressed the crowd amid songs, noted that many people in Asaba have heard of the crusade following the massive rallies, billboards in strategic places and personal invitations so far to ensure everybody in the state capital is aware of the crusade with Kumuyi. Osabuohien said Kumuyiâ€™s crusades, which have been held in states across Nigeria, had touched lives, restored hope to many wounded individuals and broken families, brought healing to various ailments and brought joy to many sorrowful hearts.
