A Non-Governmental Organisation, Coalition for Credible Elections 2023, in conjunction with the International Society for Civil Liberty and Rule of Law (Intersociety), Diaspora Medic 4 Good Governance, yesterday, urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to chat a path with various security agencies, community leaders and civil society organisations to look into challenges ahead of the general elections. National Coordinator of the group, Mr. Emmanuel Mok, while addressing the media in Lagos, stressed the need to engage all and necessary stakeholders to look into critical matters and come to workable position on how to ensure peaceful and credible elections across the country. Mok further said that there is need for community organisations to ensure safety and peace of the electoral process with the aim of ensuring no disruption of the processes by any INEC officials, security agents or third party agents. Also, Chairman, Human and Constitutional Rights Committee of the African Bar Association (AfBA), Sonnie Ekwowusi, said that as a nation, Nigeria must stand up to confront the dangers of very imminent community election violence by desperate politicians. The AfBA said that INEC should put in place credible plans and structures to ensure that anyone who instigates, funds or enables or participates in action to disrupt the election(s), intimidate voters, induce voters with money or other gifts or foodstuff or whatever, are not only checkmated but also made to face the law. “There is need for commitment of Nigerian citizens to ensure that things are done right. Also, there is need for INEC to be willing to do the right thing at every point in the large logistic programme it has,” the group said.
