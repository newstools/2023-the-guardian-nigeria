The Interim Management Committee (IMC) for the Nigerian Professional Football League (NPFL) has ruled that matches of the competition will run as scheduled to ensure a smooth conclusion of the season. In a statement signed by the Committee’s Head of Operations, Davidson Owumi, the IMC said it took the decision to avert disruption of the calendar, adding that it has already received “a raft of requests for fixtures rescheduling by a number of Nigeria Premier Football League (NPFL) clubs.” The statement cited a directive from the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), which frowned at the deluge of requests seen as threatening the integrity of the NPFL. “Consequent upon the directive of the NFF, there would be no more rescheduling of matches either for political or logistics reasons. The fixtures has to be strictly adhered to,” it said. The IMC explained that the directive is in response to a chaotic demand for fixture changes that if not checked could undermine the values of the league. The Committee advised clubs to ensure they honoured their upcoming fixtures in the league, which matchday three were concluded on Sunday, with two other fixtures in Ikenne and Port Harcourt coming up today.
