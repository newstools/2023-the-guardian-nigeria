The former Governor of Cross River State, Senator Liyel Imoke, and other chieftains of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state have called on Nigerians to shun the All Progressives Congress (APC) for failing to deliver on its promises.  On his part, the senator representing Cross River South in the National Assembly, Gershom Bassey, said that as a representative of the people, he is shocked at the negative change that the APC has brought upon the country and its citizens in the last eight years.
 
Bassey told the crowd of teeming supporters who thronged the venues that APC at the national level has failed, stating that the debt that the present administration has incurred is in trillion of naira, revealing that the APC administration has resorted to taxing the people on everything in order to meet up with the cost of running the government.
 
He assured the people that Atiku campaign organisation has come up with a blueprint and five-point agenda that will tackle the mess created by the “failed APC government”.
 
The PDP National Women Leader, Prof Stella Effa-Attoe pleaded with the people never to accept, nor vote for any party except the PDP.
 
The PDP Senatorial candidate for Cross River South, Ntufam Ekpo Okon, and the member representing Calabar Municipality/Odukpani Federal Constituency and PDP candidate, Ntufam Etta Mbora also reminded the people that if there was any chance of redeeming the present situation, then the PDP should be voted back to power at all levels.
