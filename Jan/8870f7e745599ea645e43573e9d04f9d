A breath of fresh air, this story is a take on the popular saying and myth of “EAT BEANS AND YOU WILL GROW!” “An incredible and relatable story, it centres on a young boy, Ranti, who wants to grow taller before the next school term. All from the common myth told to us by our parents, ”EAT BEANS AND YOU WILL GROW”, the story takes place in Lagos, Nigeria and captures Ranti’s journey as he is forced to believe in the one thing he hates the most, Beans!” Taeps Animation Studios has been gaining quick ground in the animation industry. The company has its eyes set on building a “Disney-Pixar of Africa” with a focus on creating personable and relatable indigenous African stories, in the most entertaining and educative way. Founded by Adeoyin Okuboyejo and Ayobami Bello with Artistic and Creative Direction by Kiitan Durosinmi-Etti, Taeps seeks to create, develop and produce magnificent and compelling stories, all of African heritage, using ground-breaking technology. This is clearly reflected in ĘwA which is produced in Stellar 4K, a new standard set in the Nigerian animation industry. Taeps vision is to create high quality branded content that revolutionises African entertainment. A few words by the CEO, Adeoyin Okuboyejo: “We are very excited about this new production, it’s an amazing and relatable story, produced in breathtaking 3D Animation and 4K Quality. Our parents always said – Eat Beans and You Will Grow – we all do not know how true this is and this was the inspiration for the story – a myth that is personable to us all. The music is stellar, sweet and communicates the story in the most amazing way – it’s the best you will see in animation today! We are really ecstatic to share this teaser with our audience today – Watch, Enjoy, Share, Follow Us and Stay Tuned for the Full Short Film Coming Soon!“ The film is Directed by Kiitan Durosinmi-Etti, Written by Bamidele Sogbesan.
