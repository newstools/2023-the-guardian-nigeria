The National Air Freight Forwarders and Consolidators (NAFFAC) has changed its name to allow it expand operations across seaports, land borders and airports in the country. The group, which is said to be the oldest in the freight forwarding subsector, will presently be known as National Association of Freight Forwarders and Consolidators (NAFFAC), with a new logo design that will match the new name. President General of the association, Prince Bakare Adeyinka, who announced the change, said the ‘Air’ in the old name had restricted the association from having its desired spread across seaports and land borders following criticisms from stakeholders. He said the new name will facilitate the association’s efforts at having chapters in all the ports, borders and airports across the country. He maintained that the new status would grant the association strength of competitiveness among other freight forwarding groups in the country, thus, engaging government agencies when necessary. “Nothing has changed except for the Air that was removed and we already have our certificate. Apart from that, we need to file our constitution and other things, which is what we are working on and I believe in the next one or two months, that should also be concluded. Immediately after that, we will design a new logo. “The Council for the Regulation of Freight Forwarding in Nigeria (CRFFN) is aware of what we are doing,” he explained.
